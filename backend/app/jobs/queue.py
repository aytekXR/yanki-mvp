"""Postgres-as-queue: claim the next analysis to run.

The ``analyses`` table *is* the queue. One transaction selects the oldest row
that is either ``queued`` or a stale ``running`` (crashed worker), locks it with
``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`` so concurrent workers never grab the same row, and
marks it ``running``. On SQLite (used by the unit tests) there is no
``SKIP LOCKED``, so we fall back to a plain SELECT + UPDATE — tests are
single-threaded so no locking is needed.
