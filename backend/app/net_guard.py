"""Shared SSRF guard: reject URLs whose host resolves to a non-public address.

The submit endpoint is anonymous, and the discovery step fetches whatever URL is
submitted (following redirects), so without this guard an attacker could make the
worker reach loopback/private/link-local hosts or the cloud metadata endpoint
(169.254.169.254). This is used both at submit time (fast rejection) and inside
discovery's HTTP client, which re-checks every redirect hop — a public URL can
302 to a private one.
