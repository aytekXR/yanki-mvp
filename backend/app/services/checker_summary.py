"""Read-time aggregation of a checker analysis's stored rows (P5.3).

The public checker promises two results the MVP crawl never surfaced: an
**engine-by-engine presence map** ("who showed up where") and the list of
**competitor brands that appeared** in the LLM answers. Both compose entirely
from rows the pipeline already writes — the ``responses`` table's ``footprint``
booleans and ``raw_text`` — so we compute them at read time in this pure helper
instead of adding a column, a pipeline step, or (crucially) an LLM call. The
whole thing is deterministic and costs **$0**.

Two aggregates, one pass:

* **engine_presence** — group the responses by ``engine`` and report, per
  engine, how many answers mentioned the company (``footprint is True``) out of
  the total answers for that engine. The per-engine totals sum to the analysis'
  ``total_responses`` and the per-engine ``mentioned`` counts sum to its
  ``footprint_count``, so the map is always consistent with the headline score.

* **competitors_appeared** — a deterministic **proper-noun co-mention
  heuristic** over the raw answers. We scan each answer for Title-Case brand
  names, **exclude** the searched company + its ``aliases`` (case-insensitively)
  and a small EN/TR stoplist of sentence-starters / connectives, count how many
  distinct answers each surviving name appears in, and return the top
  :data:`TOP_N` by that count. This deliberately does **not** intersect against
  ``kyc.competitors`` — that list is whatever the KYC step happened to name and
  would miss brands the answers actually surfaced. It captures "brands that
  showed up" faithfully, from the answers alone.

Heuristic design notes (why this is more than a naive Title-Case grep):

* **Adjacent-token grouping.** Consecutive capitalized words separated only by
  spaces are grouped into one name, so a multi-word brand like ``Yanki Demo Co``
  is treated (and excluded) as a whole — no ``Demo Co`` fragment leaks through.
  Any punctuation (comma, period, ...) between two capitalized words breaks the
  run, so ``Acme, Globex`` stays two names and a sentence boundary
  (``... Co. Other ...``) never welds two names together.
* **Stoplist.** LLM answers capitalize the first word of every sentence, so
  ``For``, ``Some``, ``Other`` (and Turkish equivalents) would masquerade as
  brands. The stoplist drops them; leading/trailing stoplist words are also
  stripped from a group (``The Acme`` -> ``Acme``). Recommendation/imperative
  verbs (``Try``, ``Choose``, ``Visit`` ...) are in the list too, so a verb that
  welds onto a following brand (``Try Acme``, ``Choose Nike``) is stripped —
  leaving the real brand, and letting its exclusion apply. It is a curated
  heuristic, not exhaustive — a real brand spelled exactly like a stopword
  (rare) would be dropped; acceptable at $0.
* **Ambiguous particle guard.** A few stoplist entries are short Turkish
  function words that also begin English brand names (``De`` Beers, ``Ben``
  Sherman, ``En`` Route). We never strip such a word from the FRONT of a
  multi-word name, so those brands keep their first token — while the same word
  standing alone (a bare TR sentence-lead) is still dropped.
* **Case-insensitive, possessive-tolerant exclusion.** The searched brand is
  stored casefolded while answers use Title-Case, so all exclusion comparisons
  casefold both sides. An answer about the brand routinely writes it possessive
  (``Nike's new line ...``), so a trailing English possessive is stripped for
  the comparison only — never from a reported name, so a competitor that
  genuinely ends in ``'s`` (``McDonald's``) keeps its name.

The helper is intentionally free of any ORM / API import: it consumes a plain
sequence of duck-typed response rows (``engine`` / ``footprint`` / ``raw_text``)
plus the ``kyc`` dict, and returns plain frozen dataclasses. The route
(``_to_out``) maps those onto the Pydantic contract models, and only for
``kind='checker'`` rows — MVP analyses carry ``null`` for both fields.
