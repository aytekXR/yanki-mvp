"""Transactional email via the Resend REST API (P5.13).

One tiny surface: ``send_email`` POSTs to ``https://api.resend.com/emails`` with
a Bearer ``resend_api_key``, a 5s timeout, over plain ``httpx`` (no vendor SDK —
zero new deps; see ADR-25). It is deliberately **fail-open** and **env-gated**:

- a NO-OP (returns ``False``) unless ``emails_enabled`` AND ``resend_api_key`` is
  non-empty, so no environment sends mail until the operator opts in;
- it NEVER raises — every error (HTTP status, timeout, connection, anything) is
  swallowed, logged as a short warning that names neither the recipient nor the
  key, and reported as a ``False`` return.

Callers therefore treat email as best-effort telemetry: a waitlist signup is
recorded in ``waitlist_signups`` and a run is recorded in ``analyses``
regardless of whether the alert mail goes out.

The compose helpers (``send_waitlist_emails``, ``send_run_alert``) build the
bodies and route them, and inherit the same never-raises guarantee because they
only ever call ``send_email``.
