"""Reusable per-IP / global rate limiting for the public write endpoints.

P5.0 wires this into ``POST /api/v1/analyses`` — the LIVE endpoint that is
already public with real keys, so a rejection must land BEFORE any ``analyses``
row is created or money is spent. The helpers here are deliberately
endpoint-agnostic: P5.6 reuses ``hash_ip`` / ``client_ip`` (with the SAME
``ip_hash_salt`` — there is no second salt) plus ``_retry_after`` for the
anonymous ``/api/v1/checker`` endpoint. ``check_checker_rate_limit`` and
``checker_daily_cost_exceeded`` add the checker's per-IP, per-brand, and
daily-cost guards; the route calls them only for a FRESH run, because a $0 24h
cache hit is exempt from every guard (see ADR-22). Because recorded
``responses.cost_usd`` LAGS the worker (a just-enqueued run has spent nothing
yet), the cost guard also projects the spend of in-flight fresh runs at a
conservative per-run estimate whenever real keys are live, so a distinct-triple
burst cannot slip an unbounded backlog past the lagging sum (see ADR-22).

Timestamp note: ``analyses.created_at`` is ``DateTime(timezone=True)`` with a
Python-side aware default. On Postgres reads come back tz-aware; on the SQLite
test DB they come back naive (UTC wall-clock). All comparisons are anchored on
``datetime.now(UTC) - timedelta(...)`` and every datetime we do arithmetic on is
normalized to aware-UTC first, so the same code is correct on both backends.

    UTC-midnight reset cliff and any timezone-of-record question; see ADR-22).

    Recorded cost LAGS actual spend: the guard runs at submit time but a run's
    ``responses`` are written by the worker later, so a just-enqueued run counts
    as $0 until it finishes. Without a backstop, a distinct-triple burst (each

    PROJECTS in-flight fresh runs (``kind='checker'`` analyses still ``queued``
    or ``running`` in the window) at ``_EST_CHECKER_RUN_COST_USD`` each, bounding
    the concurrently enqueued backlog to about ``cap / est``. The projection is
    deliberately skipped under ``DRY_RUN``: there every run completes at $0, so
    projecting a phantom cost would wrongly trip the cap — instead the recorded
    sum stays 0 and any positive cap never trips, exactly as the card requires.
    (A ``running`` run whose partial cost is already summed is also projected in
    full; that double-count is an intentional, documented safety margin.)

    Uses ``>=`` so a cap of ``0`` refuses every fresh run (kill-switch idiom).
