"""Deterministic, $0 provider used whenever ``DRY_RUN`` is on.

In DRY_RUN the whole pipeline runs on a single fictional company so the demo is
free and fully reproducible. The same mock serves two kinds of prompt:

* the KYC step asks for a JSON company profile — the mock returns a canned,
  valid profile for :data:`MOCK_COMPANY`;
* the execution step asks recommendation-style questions — the mock mentions the
  company iff ``sha256(prompt).digest()[0] % 2 == 0`` (so roughly half of the
  answers count as a footprint), otherwise it names only filler brands.
