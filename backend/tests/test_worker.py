"""Worker outcome tests: the failed-job envelope (FR-7).

A pipeline exception must become ``status='failed'`` with the error recorded,
while partial rows earlier steps committed stay queryable. ``run_once`` owns that
translation; it is exercised here against an in-memory SQLite DB by pointing the
worker's ``SessionLocal`` at it.
