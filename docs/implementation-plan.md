# Yanki — Implementation Plan (engineering execution)

*Audience: the founder-orchestrator and the coding agents they dispatch. This is
the **how** and **when** of the build — the ticket breakdown, sequencing, file
ownership, and status. The **what/why** (product) lives in
[roadmap.md](roadmap.md); the **scope authority** is [02-mvp.md](02-mvp.md). This
file does not duplicate either — it links to them.*

Related: [architecture.md](architecture.md) (how it's built),
[design.md](design.md) (repo structure + ownership + ADR log),

## How to use this doc

- **Tasks are the unit of work.** Each is sized so one autonomous agent finishes
  it in a single focused session. IDs are stable (`P<phase>.<n>`); never renumber
  — mark `superseded` instead.
- **Every task carries:** Goal · Why now · Dependencies · Complexity (S/M/L) ·
  Deliverables (files) · Acceptance criteria · Status.
- **Status vocabulary:** `todo` · `in progress — session N` · `done` ·
  `blocked (<reason>)` · `superseded`.
- **Before starting a task**, read the linked contracts and confirm no other
  agent owns your files this session (see the ownership map in
  [design.md](design.md)). **Stay inside your ownership set** — touching another
  agent's files corrupts a parallel build.
- **Cross-cutting contracts are locked** (API shapes, DB fields, env vars, ports,
  dep lists). They live in the session master SPEC and are mirrored in
  [architecture.md](architecture.md). Deviate only minimally, and record the
  deviation in your session summary.
- **The project must always run.** Build and test each pipeline step behind
  `DRY_RUN=1` before wiring a real key. Nothing Phase-4+ starts until the Phase-3
  happy path renders a score.

### Current Priority

✅ **Session 1 (2026-07-09): Phase 0 → Phase 3 landed and verified in one
orchestrated pass.** The DRY_RUN stack boots and was driven end-to-end —
`POST` a URL → `202` → the six pipeline steps run → a GEO score renders
(`geo_score=0.6`, `total_responses=40` = 10 prompts × 4 mock engines); the
failure and `422` paths hold. A 5-dimension adversarial review pass confirmed
and fixed 16 findings (SSRF guard, footprint word boundaries, idempotent
re-runs, prod Dockerfile, deploy-script fixes) with the live smoke re-verified
afterwards. Default ports stay web `8140` / api `8141`, overridable via
`YANKI_WEB_PORT`/`YANKI_API_PORT`/`YANKI_DB_PORT`.

✅ **Session 2 (2026-07-09): the key-free CI + accessibility polish landed.**
P4.3 (CI hardening) and P4.5 (a11y audit) are done and P4.4's Playwright e2e job
is authored — but none of it has run on a real GitHub runner yet (there is still
no remote). Locally, `make lint`/`typecheck`/`test` are green (**64** backend
tests incl. real-Postgres `SKIP LOCKED` queue tests on `:5433`, **20** vitest
across 8 files) and a fresh DRY_RUN smoke re-verified the whole loop. See the
per-task notes below for exactly what was proven vs. authored-but-unproven.

✅ **Session 3 (2026-07-10): P4.6 landed — Phase 5 decomposed (planning only).**
The roadmap **Next** 2a slice (free public checker) is broken into 11
session-sized tasks — see **Phase 5** below (preamble, build gate, lanes, merge
risks, P5.1–P5.11). Produced by a 3-proposal / 3-judge / 3-lens
adversarial-verify orchestration; no code changed and `make test` stayed green
(64 backend + 20 frontend).

📣 **Post-close update (2026-07-10): the operator pushed to GitHub**
(`github.com/aytekXR/yanki-mvp`) **and the first-ever CI run executed: 4 of 5
jobs green on the first attempt** (backend / frontend / contract-drift /
secrets-gitleaks). The **e2e job is red** — it died at `npm ci`, before
Playwright: the job boots the bind-mounting compose stack first, the web
container (root) writes `frontend/node_modules` into the checkout, and the
runner user then gets `EACCES`. Diagnosis in tech-debt item 2.

➡️ **Next up: (1) fix the e2e CI job** (order/ownership fix in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` — the first code task of session 4, no operator
input needed), then the operator-gated pair: **P4.1 — real-key smoke + Week-1
invoice check** (needs keys in `deploy/.env`), then **P4.2 — deploy to
test.beyondkaira.com** (supervised). Phase 5 is decomposed but frozen behind
its build gate (P4.1 + P4.2 + all-five-green CI).

### Readiness snapshot (updated at each session close)

Last updated: 2026-07-10 (session 3 + post-close CI addendum).

- **MVP plan completion (Phases 0–4): 29.5 / 32 tasks ≈ 92%.** Phases 0–3:
  26/26 done. Phase 4: P4.3 + P4.5 + P4.6 done, P4.4 authored (counted ½ —
  proof needs the first push), P4.1 + P4.2 operator-gated. Nothing key-free
  remains: every open item now needs the operator.
- **Phase 5 (post-MVP checker): decomposed, 0 / 11 built.** P4.6's deliverable
  is the P5.1–P5.11 breakdown below — planning only; its build gate (P4.1 +
  P4.2 + first green CI) is unmet. Counting Phase 5, the enlarged plan stands
  at 29.5 / 43 ≈ 69%.
- **Production readiness: ~72%** (session 3 closed at ~70%; nudged by the
  post-close first CI run). Code, tests (64 backend + 20 frontend), docs, CI
  config, secret scanning, and accessibility are done and verified locally —
  and **4 of the 5 CI jobs are now proven on a real runner** (first push,
  2026-07-10). Still missing, in order: the e2e CI job green (diagnosed fix,
  agent-side), real-key cost validation (P4.1, operator), first supervised
  deploy (P4.2, operator) — plus rate limiting before any public URL
  (accepted debt, planned task P5.6).
- **On track vs. original plan: yes, with sequencing changes only.** Scope is
  unchanged (02-mvp.md §4 frozen; Phase 5 stays behind its build gate). No new
  deviation this session — P4.6 ran exactly per the session-2 brief's
  neither-gate-unblocked branch. Prior recorded deviations stand: P4.3/P4.5
  before P4.1 (key-blocked fallback), P4.4 split authored vs. proven, P4.3
  without a `.gitleaks.toml`.

### Agent lanes (parallelism map)

The session runs these lanes in parallel; the merge risks are the shared
contracts between them.

| Lane | Owns | Phase-1/2/3 tasks |
|---|---|---|
| **backend-spine** | `backend/` (config, db, api, jobs, services, worker, alembic, `tests/{conftest,test_api,test_queue,test_queue_postgres}.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `Dockerfile`) | P1.1–P1.6, P2.10a |
| **pipeline** | `backend/app/pipeline/**`, `backend/app/providers/**`, `backend/tests/pipeline/**` | P2.1–P2.9, P2.10b |
| **frontend** | `frontend/**` | P1.7, P3.1–P3.5 |
| **infra** | `Makefile`, `deploy/**`, `scripts/**`, `.github/**`, `.gitignore`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, README link fixes | P0.2, P1.8, P4.2–P4.4 |
| **docs** | `docs/**` (one file per agent) | P0.3 |

**Shared-contract merge risks (coordinate before editing):**
- The **API envelope** (`GET /api/v1/analyses/{id}`) binds backend-spine ↔
  frontend. It is generated into `shared/contracts/openapi.json` →
  `frontend/lib/types.ts` by `make gen-types` (P3.1) — never hand-edit those; the
  frontend imports through the hand-maintained `frontend/lib/contracts.ts` seam.
- The **`KYC` / `PromptSpec` / `ProviderResult`** shapes bind pipeline ↔
  backend-spine (the worker calls the pipeline).
- **Config env vars** bind all lanes; the locked list lives in
  [architecture.md](architecture.md) and `deploy/.env.example`.
- **DB schema** is owned by backend-spine's Alembic migration; pipeline reads/
  writes those tables via the models but may not alter the migration.

---

## Phase 0 — Repository sanity

Goal: a clean, documented, ignorable-noise-free repo a new agent can navigate.

### P0.1 — Git init + baseline commit
- **Goal:** repo under version control with an initial baseline.
- **Why now:** every later task needs a repo to branch from.
- **Dependencies:** none.
- **Complexity:** S
- **Deliverables:** initialized `.git`, baseline commit of existing docs.
- **Acceptance:** `git log` shows a baseline commit; tree is clean.
- **Status:** done

### P0.2 — .gitignore + README link/consistency fixes
- **Goal:** ignore build/venv/node/env noise; fix README doc links (README points
  at `docs/mvp.md` but the file is `docs/02-mvp.md`) and confirm the Make-target
  and port tables match the SPEC.
- **Why now:** stops secrets/artifacts leaking into commits and stops the front
  door pointing at 404s.
- **Dependencies:** P0.1.
- **Complexity:** S
- **Deliverables:** `.gitignore` (Python, Node, env files, `.venv`, `__pycache__`,
  `node_modules`, `.next`, coverage, `deploy/.env`), README link fixes.
- **Acceptance:** `git status` is clean after a build; every README doc link
  resolves to an existing file; no `deploy/.env` is trackable.
- **Status:** done (session 1)

### P0.3 — Author the doc set
- **Goal:** author/refresh the docs so no doc drifts from the planned build:
  `design.md`, `architecture.md`, `roadmap.md`, `test-suite.md`, this
  `implementation-plan.md`; fill empty placeholders (`session-rules.md`,
  `agent-workflows.md`) or delete them.
- **Why now:** docs are the shared brain across short, context-limited sessions.
- **Dependencies:** the locked SPEC.
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** the docs above (one agent per file).
- **Acceptance:** every doc cross-links correctly; no empty non-placeholder files
  remain; scope authority and contracts are consistent across docs.
- **Status:** done (session 1)

---

## Phase 1 — Foundations (the spine that everything hangs on)

Goal: an empty-but-running stack — api answers `/healthz`, worker polls an empty
queue, frontend renders a shell, `make dev` boots all four services. No pipeline
logic yet.

### P1.1 — Backend config
- **Goal:** `app/config.py` — pydantic-settings `Settings` reading the locked env
  vars (`DATABASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `DRY_RUN`=true,
  `PROMPT_COUNT`=10, `PANEL_ENGINES`, `MAX_RESPONSES_PER_JOB`=60,
  `WORKER_POLL_SECONDS`=2, `STALE_CLAIM_SECONDS`=300) with the SPEC defaults.
- **Why now:** every other backend module imports settings.
- **Dependencies:** `pyproject.toml` deps present.
- **Complexity:** S
- **Deliverables:** `backend/app/config.py`, `backend/app/__init__.py`.
- **Acceptance:** importing `settings` with no env set yields the documented
  defaults; `DRY_RUN` defaults **true** (safe by default).
- **Status:** done (session 1)

### P1.2 — DB base, models, session
- **Goal:** SQLAlchemy 2.0 models for `analyses`, `prompts`, `responses`,
  `llm_cache` per the locked schema; session factory; SQLite-compatible column
  choices (so unit tests run in-memory — see [test-suite.md](test-suite.md) §3.3).
- **Why now:** the queue, services, and pipeline all read/write these tables.
- **Dependencies:** P1.1.
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** `backend/app/db/{base.py,models.py,session.py}`.
- **Acceptance:** models create cleanly on both SQLite and Postgres; UUID pks
  default to `uuid4`; timestamps are timezone-aware.
- **Status:** done (session 1)

### P1.3 — Alembic initial migration
- **Goal:** one migration creating all four tables + the `llm_cache.cache_key`
  unique index.
- **Why now:** `make migrate` and the deploy flow need a real schema.
- **Dependencies:** P1.2.
- **Complexity:** S
- **Deliverables:** `backend/alembic/**` (env + one revision).
- **Acceptance:** `alembic upgrade head` on a fresh Postgres creates the four
  tables; `downgrade base` drops them.
- **Status:** done (session 1)

### P1.4 — Postgres-as-queue
- **Goal:** `app/jobs/queue.py` — claim one job in a single transaction
  (`status='queued' OR (running AND claimed_at < now()-STALE_CLAIM_SECONDS)`,
  `ORDER BY created_at LIMIT 1 FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`), set `running`,
  `claimed_at=now()`, `attempts+=1`; `attempts>3 → failed`; a heartbeat helper to
  bump `claimed_at` between steps.
- **Why now:** the worker's correctness (NFR-3: never lose or double-run) lives
  here.
- **Dependencies:** P1.2.
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** `backend/app/jobs/queue.py`.
- **Acceptance:** two concurrent claimers never grab the same row; a stale
  `running` row is reclaimed; `attempts>3` flips to `failed` with
  `error='max retries exceeded'`.
- **Status:** done (session 1)

### P1.5 — API layer + service glue
- **Goal:** `app/api/{main,routes,schemas}.py` + `app/services/analyses.py`
  implementing the locked contract: `GET /healthz`; `POST /api/v1/analyses`
  (valid → **202** `{id}`, invalid → **422**); `GET /api/v1/analyses/{id}` (full
  envelope with `result` **always present**, inner fields null until produced,
  unknown id → 404). Progress/step mapping per SPEC.
- **Why now:** it is the FE/BE contract surface and the entry point for the whole
  loop (FR-1, FR-2, FR-7).
- **Dependencies:** P1.2, P1.4.
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** `backend/app/api/{main.py,routes.py,schemas.py}`,
  `backend/app/services/analyses.py`.
- **Acceptance:** matches the API contract exactly (see
  [architecture.md](architecture.md)); `app.openapi()` is exportable for
  `make gen-types`.
- **Status:** done (session 1)

### P1.6 — Worker skeleton
- **Goal:** `app/worker.py` — `while True` loop: claim a job (P1.4), run the
  pipeline (stubbed call for now — real steps land in P2.9), `time.sleep(POLL)`;
  on any exception mark `failed` with `str(exc)` truncated to 500 chars, partial
  rows kept.
- **Why now:** proves the queue drains; P2.9 fills in the real pipeline call.
- **Dependencies:** P1.4, P1.5.
- **Complexity:** S
- **Deliverables:** `backend/app/worker.py`.
- **Acceptance:** worker starts, claims a queued row, marks it `running` then
  `done` (stub), sleeps, repeats; a raised exception marks the job `failed`
  without crashing the loop.
- **Status:** done (session 1)

### P1.7 — Frontend scaffold + brand tokens
- **Goal:** Next.js 15 App Router + TS + Tailwind scaffold; copy the
  [frontend-brandkit.md](frontend-brandkit.md) §2 tokens into the Tailwind config;
  `next.config` `rewrites()` proxying `/api/:path*` and `/healthz` to
  `API_ORIGIN` (default `http://localhost:8141`) so there is **no CORS** and FE
  fetches relative paths only.
- **Why now:** the three screens (P3.x) need a themed shell and the proxy.
- **Dependencies:** none (contract-only dependency on the API shape).
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** `frontend/` scaffold, `tailwind.config`, `next.config`,
  `package.json` with the locked deps.
- **Acceptance:** `npm run dev` serves a themed placeholder on `:8140`;
  `/healthz` proxies to the api; brand tokens resolve in Tailwind classes.
- **Status:** done (session 1)

### P1.8 — Compose + Makefile + Dockerfile + env example
- **Goal:** the single control panel. `deploy/docker-compose.yml` (db + api +
  worker + web, bind-mount hot reload); one backend `Dockerfile`
  (`python:3.12-slim` + `uv sync`, `CMD uvicorn app.api.main:app`) run as both api
  and worker; `Makefile` targets per the README contract; `deploy/.env.example`
  (all config vars + `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `DRY_RUN=1` default, commented, **no
  real keys**).
- **Why now:** `make dev` is the definition-of-done boot command.
- **Dependencies:** P1.1–P1.7 (services to compose).
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** `deploy/docker-compose.yml`, `backend/Dockerfile`, `Makefile`,
  `deploy/.env.example`, `scripts/` bootstrap helpers.
- **Acceptance:** `make dev` boots all four services with hot reload; `make help`
  lists every target in the README table; `make migrate` runs against the db
  container.
- **Status:** done (session 1)

---

## Phase 2 — Core MVP (the GEO engine)

Goal: the six pipeline steps + providers, each unit-tested at $0 under
`DRY_RUN=1`, wired into the worker so a claimed job runs end-to-end and persists
partial results after every step (FR-3–FR-5, FR-8). Build test-first
([test-suite.md](test-suite.md) §8).

### P2.1 — Provider interface + mock + registry
- **Goal:** `providers/base.py` (`Provider` Protocol: `name`, `model`,
  `generate(prompt) -> ProviderResult(text, model, cost_usd)`); `providers/mock.py`
  (deterministic — mentions company iff `sha256(prompt).digest()[0] % 2 == 0`,
  cost 0); `providers/registry.py` (`get_panel` → 4 `MockProvider`s when
  `DRY_RUN`, else map `PANEL_ENGINES`; `get_analysis_provider` for the KYC call).
- **Why now:** every downstream step and test depends on the mock + registry.
- **Dependencies:** P1.1.
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** `backend/app/providers/{base.py,mock.py,registry.py}`.
- **Acceptance:** `DRY_RUN=1` yields four mocks named after the panel engines; the
  mock is deterministic and free; registry is the single provider entry point.
- **Status:** done (session 1)

### P2.2 — Real + stub providers
- **Goal:** `anthropic_provider.py` (real, `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, anthropic
  SDK, `max_tokens=1024`, cost = tokens × a price-table constant);
  `openai_provider.py` (real, `gpt-4o-mini`, openai SDK); `gemini_provider.py` +
  `perplexity_provider.py` (STUBS: canned plausible answer that *sometimes
  mentions nothing*, model `"stub"`, cost 0).
- **Why now:** completes the panel shape; real adapters are exercised only via
  `respx` in tests (never a live call — [test-suite.md](test-suite.md) §1).
- **Dependencies:** P2.1.
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** `backend/app/providers/{anthropic_provider,openai_provider,gemini_provider,perplexity_provider}.py`.
- **Acceptance:** each satisfies the `Provider` protocol; real adapters unit-test
  their HTTP shape under `respx`; stubs return `cost_usd=0`, model `"stub"`.
- **Status:** done (session 1)

### P2.3 — Discovery
- **Goal:** `pipeline/discovery.py` `discover(url) -> str`: httpx GET (15s timeout,
  UA `YankiBot/0.1`), BeautifulSoup parse, drop script/style/nav, homepage text +
  up to 5 same-domain links, cap ~20k chars; unreachable/empty →
  `PipelineError("could not read the site")`.
- **Why now:** step 1 of the loop; feeds KYC.
- **Dependencies:** P1.1.
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** `backend/app/pipeline/discovery.py`, `pipeline/errors.py`
  (`PipelineError`).
- **Acceptance:** reachable page → non-empty text; unreachable → `PipelineError`,
  no crash (test-suite §3.2, via `respx`).
- **Status:** done (session 1)

### P2.4 — KYC
- **Goal:** `pipeline/kyc.py` `generate_kyc(text, url, provider) -> KYC`: one LLM
  call for strict JSON; strip ```json fences; validate against Pydantic `KYC`
  (company, description, industry, aliases — always include company name +
  registrable domain without TLD; products/services/keywords/locations/
  competitors default `[]`).
- **Why now:** step 2; its output drives prompt generation and footprint aliases.
- **Dependencies:** P2.1.
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** `backend/app/pipeline/kyc.py`, the `KYC` model.
- **Acceptance:** given canned model output, parses + validates; `aliases`
  contains the company name and the domain name (test-suite §3.2).
- **Status:** done (session 1)

### P2.5 — Prompts (deterministic templates)
- **Goal:** `pipeline/prompts.py` `generate_prompts(kyc, count) ->
  list[PromptSpec]`: cycle categories (recommendation / comparison / alternatives
  / best-of / use-case), fill from KYC, no LLM. Exactly `count`, all non-empty, no
  duplicates.
- **Why now:** step 3; pure + free + the widest unit-test surface.
- **Dependencies:** P2.4 (`KYC` shape).
- **Complexity:** S
- **Deliverables:** `backend/app/pipeline/prompts.py`, `PromptSpec`.
- **Acceptance:** exactly `count` specs, each non-empty with a category, no dupes
  (test-suite §3.2). Aim ~100% branch coverage.
- **Status:** done (session 1)

### P2.6 — Execute (fan-out + llm_cache)
- **Goal:** `pipeline/execute.py`: for each prompt × each panel engine, consult
  `llm_cache` (fresh <24h) else call the provider, then insert a `responses` row
  and a cache row; enforce `MAX_RESPONSES_PER_JOB` (stop + log); persist after each
  response (crash-safe).
- **Why now:** step 4; the cost-control + audit-trail heart (FR-4, FR-8).
- **Dependencies:** P2.1, P2.5, P1.2.
- **Complexity:** L
- **Deliverables:** `backend/app/pipeline/execute.py`.
- **Acceptance:** one `responses` row per engine per prompt; a warm cache means no
  second provider call; `MAX_RESPONSES_PER_JOB` never exceeded (test-suite §3.2).
- **Status:** done (session 1)

### P2.7 — Footprint
- **Goal:** `pipeline/footprint.py` `detect(raw_text, kyc) -> (bool, snippet|None)`:
  pure, deterministic, case-insensitive search over company/aliases/domain; on hit
  return a ±60-char snippet around the first match; no LLM.
- **Why now:** step 5; the "show our work" evidence (FR-5).
- **Dependencies:** P2.4 (`KYC`).
- **Complexity:** S
- **Deliverables:** `backend/app/pipeline/footprint.py`.
- **Acceptance:** present → `(True, snippet)`; absent → `(False, None)`;
  deterministic (test-suite §3.2). Aim ~100% branch coverage.
- **Status:** done (session 1)

### P2.8 — Scoring
- **Goal:** `pipeline/scoring.py` `geo_score(footprints, total) -> float`: pure;
  `0.0` when `total==0` (ADR-11, no divide-by-zero).
- **Why now:** step 6; the number the whole product sells (must be provably
  correct).
- **Dependencies:** none.
- **Complexity:** S
- **Deliverables:** `backend/app/pipeline/scoring.py`.
- **Acceptance:** `score == footprints/total`; `total==0` → `0.0` (test-suite
  §3.2). Aim 100% coverage.
- **Status:** done (session 1)

### P2.9 — Pipeline orchestrator (wire into worker)
- **Goal:** a `run_pipeline(session, analysis_id, settings)` entry point that runs
  discovery → kyc → prompts → execute → footprint → scoring in order, updating
  `status`/`progress`/`current_step` per the SPEC mapping (15/30/45/80/90/100),
  heart-beating `claimed_at`, persisting each step's output; the P1.6 worker calls
  it.
- **Why now:** turns six modules into the running loop; the seam pipeline ↔
  backend-spine must agree on.
- **Dependencies:** P2.3–P2.8, P1.6.
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** `backend/app/pipeline/runner.py` (`run_pipeline`); worker
  wiring (backend-spine imports it).
- **Acceptance:** a claimed job walks all six steps, advances progress correctly,
  and lands `done` at 100 under `DRY_RUN=1`; any step exception → `failed`, partial
  rows kept (FR-7).
- **Status:** done (session 1)

### P2.10 — Backend tests
- **Goal (a, backend-spine):** `tests/conftest.py` (client, db_session, pg_engine
  auto-skip, mock_provider fixtures), `tests/test_api.py` (Submit + Results rows),
  `tests/test_queue.py` (claim / stale-reaper / `attempts>3` on SQLite), and
  `tests/test_queue_postgres.py` (the Postgres-only `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
  concurrency guard — runs only when `TEST_DATABASE_URL` points at a live
  Postgres, else skips).
  **Goal (b, pipeline):** `tests/pipeline/conftest.py` (sample_kyc, sample_html) +
  one test file per step per the acceptance→test map.
- **Why now:** TDD is how each step is built; `make test` must be green at
  session end.
- **Dependencies:** the code each test covers.
- **Complexity:** L
- **Deliverables:** `backend/tests/**` (split by ownership above).
- **Acceptance:** a test exists for every [02-mvp.md §8](02-mvp.md) acceptance row
  ([test-suite.md](test-suite.md) §9); `make test` green; DB tests auto-skip with
  no Postgres.
- **Status:** done (session 1)

---

## Phase 3 — Usable MVP (the three screens, wired end-to-end)

Goal: a human submits a URL at `:8140` and watches the six steps render into a
GEO score with every raw answer behind it — the whole-loop definition of done.

### P3.1 — API client + generated types (contract)
- **Goal:** `lib/api.ts` (thin fetch wrapper over relative `/api/v1/...`);
  `make gen-types` runs `scripts/gen_openapi.py` to export `app.openapi()` →
  `shared/contracts/openapi.json`, then `openapi-typescript` →
  `frontend/lib/types.ts` (both checked in, never hand-edited). The app never
  imports `types.ts` directly: `lib/contracts.ts` is a hand-maintained seam that
  re-exports the generated `components['schemas']` under friendly names
  (`Analysis`, `Prompt`, …) and narrows the free-form fields (`status`,
  `current_step`, `kyc`) to their locked SPEC shapes.
- **Why now:** the FE/BE contract cannot silently drift (NFR-6); the screens type
  against `contracts.ts`, which is anchored to the generated types.
- **Dependencies:** P1.5 (openapi export), P1.7.
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** `frontend/lib/{api.ts,types.ts,contracts.ts}`,
  `scripts/gen_openapi.py`, `shared/contracts/openapi.json`.
- **Acceptance:** `make gen-types` regenerates both artifacts byte-stably; a
  contract change shows up as a diff (CI drift gate is P4.3); `contracts.ts`
  compiles against the regenerated `types.ts`.
- **Status:** done (session 1)

### P3.2 — Landing page + UrlForm
- **Goal:** `/` with headline "See how AI answers talk about your brand." and a
  `UrlForm` that validates client-side and POSTs to create an analysis, then
  routes to `/analyses/[id]`.
- **Why now:** the entry screen (FR-6).
- **Dependencies:** P3.1, brandkit components.
- **Complexity:** S
- **Deliverables:** `frontend/app/page.tsx`,
  `frontend/components/{Button,UrlForm}.tsx`.
- **Acceptance:** blank/malformed URL rejected client-side (no submit fires); a
  valid `https://…` submits and navigates.
- **Status:** done (session 1)

### P3.3 — Progress + results screen
- **Goal:** `/analyses/[id]` polls `GET` every 2s. queued/running →
  `StepProgress` (six steps from `current_step`+`progress`). done → `ScoreGauge`
  + `ResultsTable` + KYC JSON block + prompts list. failed → danger card with
  `error` + retry link.
- **Why now:** the live-progress + results screen — the payoff (FR-6, FR-7).
- **Dependencies:** P3.1, P3.2.
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** `frontend/app/analyses/[id]/page.tsx`,
  `frontend/components/{StepProgress,ScoreGauge,ResultsTable}.tsx`.
- **Acceptance:** all three states render from the real envelope; the gauge
  exposes an aria-label describing the score.
- **Status:** done (session 1)

### P3.4 — Frontend component tests
- **Goal:** vitest + testing-library for `UrlForm` validation, `ScoreGauge`
  aria-label, and the `lib/score.ts` score→color-band helper (mock `lib/api.ts`,
  no network).
- **Why now:** the UI rows of the acceptance→test map (test-suite §9).
- **Dependencies:** P3.2, P3.3.
- **Complexity:** S
- **Deliverables:** `frontend/tests/{UrlForm,ScoreGauge}.test.tsx`,
  `frontend/tests/score.test.ts`, and `frontend/lib/score.ts` (the color-band
  helper under test).
- **Acceptance:** the three P3.4 vitest files (`UrlForm.test.tsx`,
  `ScoreGauge.test.tsx`, `score.test.ts`) are green with 9 tests; the three
  logic-bearing units have a test each. (P4.5 later grew the full
  `npm test -- --run` suite to 20 tests across 8 files.)
- **Status:** done (session 1)

### P3.5 — Playwright happy path + DRY_RUN e2e verification
- **Goal:** `e2e/happy-path.spec.ts` (submit `https://example.com` against a
  running `DRY_RUN=1` stack → six steps → assert a score renders; **gated on
  `E2E_BASE_URL`**, skipped otherwise). Then manually verify the full loop against
  `make dev`.
- **Why now:** the whole-MVP acceptance (02-mvp.md §8 last row); proves the
  session's definition of done.
- **Dependencies:** P2.9, P3.3, P1.8.
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** `frontend/e2e/happy-path.spec.ts`,
  `frontend/playwright.config.ts`.
- **Acceptance:** with a booted DRY_RUN stack and `E2E_BASE_URL` set, the spec
  passes; unset → skipped (keeps `make test` fast + hermetic).
- **Status:** done (session 1) — spec authored and the full loop **manually**
  verified end-to-end against a live DRY_RUN stack. The automated Playwright run
  was skipped in this env (chromium needs a root `install-deps`); running it in
  CI is P4.4.

---

## Phase 4 — Polish (P4.3 + P4.5 + P4.6 done, P4.4 authored; P4.1 + P4.2 operator-gated)

Goal: take the working DRY_RUN loop to a live, cost-validated, CI-guarded deploy,
then start the first [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) **Next** items. Each task is sized
for one focused agent session. **Do not start any Phase-4 task until the Phase-3
happy path renders a score.**

### P4.1 — Real-key smoke test + Week-1 invoice check
- **Goal:** run one real analysis with `DRY_RUN=0` and real Anthropic + OpenAI
  keys (Gemini/Perplexity stay stubbed); confirm responses, footprints, and a
  score; capture the actual per-analysis cost and check it against the caps
  (NFR-1). Record the number for the pricing decision in
  [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) 2d.
- **Why now:** validates the cost model before anything goes public; the one thing
  DRY_RUN cannot prove.
- **Dependencies:** all of Phase 3 green.
- **Complexity:** S
- **Deliverables:** a cost note (in the session summary / feasibility doc), no
  code unless a bug surfaces.
- **Acceptance:** a real run completes within the caps; the measured cost is
  recorded; no secret is committed.
- **Status:** todo

### P4.2 — Deploy to test.beyondkaira.com
- **Goal:** finish and exercise the ams-pulse-style `deploy/` scripts (build, tag
  by git SHA, `compose -p yanki-prod up`, `/healthz` check, rollback to a
  last-good-SHA file); drop the Caddy import snippet; first real deploy.
- **Why now:** turns "runs on my laptop" into a shareable URL for design partners.
- **Dependencies:** P1.8, P4.1.
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** `deploy/{deploy.sh,rollback.sh,...}`,
  `deploy/caddy/test.beyondkaira.com.caddy`, README deploy section verified.
- **Acceptance:** `make deploy` builds, migrates, health-checks, and serves
  `https://test.beyondkaira.com`; `make rollback` restores the last-good SHA.
  (Scripts are currently marked UNTESTED tech debt — this task clears that.)
- **Status:** todo

### P4.3 — CI hardening
- **Goal:** GitHub Actions: `make lint` + `make typecheck` + `make test` (with a
  Postgres service so DB tests actually run), an **OpenAPI drift gate** (fail if
  `make gen-types` produces a diff — NFR-6), and **gitleaks** in pre-commit + CI
  (NFR-5).
- **Why now:** locks in the contract-safety and secret-safety guarantees before
  more hands touch the repo.
- **Dependencies:** P2.10, P3.1.
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`,
  gitleaks config.
- **Acceptance:** CI runs the full suite green on a clean PR, red on a contract
  drift or a planted secret.
- **Status:** done (session 2). The workflow now has **five** jobs: `backend`
  (ruff + mypy + pytest against a Postgres service), `frontend` (typecheck +
  lint + vitest + build), `contract` (OpenAPI drift gate), `secrets` (gitleaks
  `8.28.0`, checksum-verified binary, full-history `gitleaks git .` scan), and
  the P4.4 `e2e` job. Pre-commit adds a gitleaks hook plus basic hygiene checks
  (`check-merge-conflict`, `detect-private-key`, `check-added-large-files`) in
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml`; `gitleaks/gitleaks-action` was deliberately avoided
  (it requires a `GITLEAKS_LICENSE` for org repos). **Deliverable deviation:** no
  `.gitleaks.toml` was written — the clean full-history scan needed no allowlist;
  add one only if a future false positive demands it. Everything provable locally
  was proven, including both the RED path (planted secret flagged, direct scan
  and via the pre-commit hook) and the GREEN path (clean 5-commit history).
  **First-push proof landed 2026-07-10** (run 29058049101 on
  `aytekXR/yanki-mvp`): backend, frontend, contract-drift, and secrets all
  green on the first-ever real-runner execution — the P4.3 jobs are proven.
  (The fifth job, P4.4's e2e, failed pre-Playwright; see P4.4.)

### P4.4 — Playwright in CI
- **Goal:** a CI job that boots the `DRY_RUN=1` stack, sets `E2E_BASE_URL`, and
  runs `e2e/happy-path.spec.ts`.
- **Why now:** guards the whole-loop against regressions once it's shared.
- **Dependencies:** P3.5, P4.3.
- **Complexity:** S
- **Deliverables:** an e2e job in `.github/workflows/`.
- **Acceptance:** the happy path runs (not skipped) and passes in CI.
- **Status:** done pending first-push proof (operator). The `e2e` job exists in
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: it writes `deploy/.env` with `DRY_RUN=1`, brings
  the stack up (`docker compose up -d --build`), waits on api `:8141/healthz`
  and web `:8140`, `npm ci`, `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`, runs
  `e2e/happy-path.spec.ts` with `E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8140`, dumps
  compose logs on failure, and tears down (`down -v`, always). **Executed once
  and failed (2026-07-10, first push, run 29058049101):** the stack booted and
  both health waits passed on the runner, but `npm ci` died with `EACCES` —
  the compose boot (bind mount, root container) precedes the install and
  root-owns `frontend/node_modules`. The Playwright spec itself still has
  never run anywhere. **Fix is session 4's first task:** install deps before
  booting the stack and/or `chown` the mount (diagnosis in tech-debt item 2);
  status stays *authored, unproven* until the job goes green.

### P4.5 — Accessibility + polish audit
- **Goal:** audit the three screens against [frontend-brandkit.md](frontend-brandkit.md)
  §7 (contrast, focus states, aria, keyboard nav, reduced-motion) and fix gaps;
  tidy loading/empty/error states.
- **Why now:** the checker is a public marketing surface — accessibility is table
  stakes before launch.
- **Dependencies:** Phase 3 green.
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** frontend fixes; a short audit note.
- **Acceptance:** the §7 checklist passes; no critical axe violations on the three
  screens.
- **Status:** done (session 2). The audit produced 9 findings (A1–A9); **8 are
  fixed, A8** (per-state `document.title`) **deferred as MVP gold-plating.**
  Fixes: new `success-700` (`#15803d`) / `danger-700` (`#b91c1c`) token shades
  for text/glyphs on the `-soft` fills (badges/headings/checks raised to
  ≥4.5:1), a stronger `UrlForm` input border (`surface-subtle #64748b`) for WCAG
  1.4.11, `role="alert"` on the failure card and `role="status"` on the loading
  paragraph, a 40px-min "Try another URL" target, and an empty-responses guard.
  New axe smoke tests cover all three screens (`tests/*.a11y.test.tsx`).
  **Caveat:** axe's `color-contrast` rule cannot run under jsdom (no
  layout/paint), so the contrast fixes are guarded by manually computed ratios,
  not automated tests.

### P4.6 — Kick off roadmap "Next" (free public checker)
- **Goal:** the first [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) **Next** slice — begin 2a (public
  no-signup checker: brand + category → fixed prompts × 4 engines, cached 24h,
  rate-limited, email-gated). Break it into P5.x tasks in a follow-up session.
- **Why now:** the checker is the demand test and launch wedge; it ships weeks
  before the app.
- **Dependencies:** all of Phase 4 above; a green, deployed MVP.
- **Complexity:** L (multi-session — decompose first)
- **Deliverables:** a new **Phase 5** task breakdown in this doc; no build until
  decomposed.
- **Acceptance:** Phase 5 tasks exist, each session-sized; scope stays frozen per
  02-mvp.md §4 until the MVP is signed off.
- **Status:** done (session 3) — planning only, per the acceptance: the **Phase 5**
  section below (preamble + build gate + lanes/merge risks + P5.1–P5.11) is the
  deliverable. Produced by a 3-proposal (lean-ship / abuse-cost-first /
  wedge-first) → 3-judge → synthesis → 3-lens adversarial-verify orchestration,
  with the final verifier findings hand-adjudicated (notably: leads/demand made
  per-submit via `checker_submissions` so the 24h cache can't lose leads). No
  build started. **Dependency deviation (recorded):** the *decomposition* ran
  before P4.1/P4.2 per the session-2 brief's neither-gate-unblocked branch — the
  listed dependencies gate the Phase-5 *build*, which stays frozen. See
  [sessions/2026-07-10-01.md](sessions/2026-07-10-01.md).

## Phase 5 — Free public checker (roadmap 2a)

**Phase goal.** Ship the free, no-signup public checker: a visitor types a
**brand + category**, we run **12 fixed prompts × 4 engines** live, and they see a
GEO score, an engine-by-engine presence map, the **competitors that showed up**,
and at least one full raw answer — the full report costs an email address. English
**and** Turkish. This is the demand test, the lead magnet, and the launch asset in
one ([roadmap.md](roadmap.md) 2a; [00-first-mvp-draft.md](00-first-mvp-draft.md)
"The free checker").

**Design stance (why this is small).** The checker is a *thin variation of the loop
we already run*, not a new product. It reuses the existing six-step pipeline, the
`analyses`/`prompts`/`responses`/`llm_cache` tables, the Postgres-as-queue worker,
the provider registry, the `GET /api/v1/analyses/{id}` envelope, and the
`ScoreGauge`/`ResultsTable`/`StepProgress` components **unchanged**. Only four
things vary: (1) the input is brand+category, so step 1 "discovery" builds a seed
string instead of crawling a URL and step 2 KYC runs **as-is** (aliases fall out
for free, and the reused KYC keeps the DRY_RUN score coherent — see below); (2)
step 3 uses a **fixed, version-stamped** bilingual 12-prompt set instead of
`PROMPT_COUNT` generated prompts; (3) two read-time results (presence map +
competitors) are computed from rows we already store; (4) a public surface needs
abuse guards and a lead capture. Net new persistence: nullable columns on
`analyses` (`kind`, `brand`, `category`, `lang`) plus **one small append-only
table**, `checker_submissions` — one row per checker submit (cache-served hits
included) carrying `ip_hash`, `lang`, and a nullable lead `email`. The table
exists because the 24h per-brand cache shares one `analyses` row across many
visitors: leads and demand counting must be per-**submit**, or repeat visitors to
a hot cached brand would overwrite each other's emails and cache hits would
vanish from the demand numbers. Net new endpoints: **two**
(`POST /api/v1/checker`, `POST /api/v1/checker/leads`), both extending the OpenAPI
app through the `make gen-types` flow. No Redis, no queue, no new infrastructure —
the boring stack stays boring (NFR-4, ADR-2).

**Build-start GATE.** Phase 5 stays **frozen** until the MVP is signed off — the
[02-mvp.md §3](02-mvp.md) in-scope flow, which that doc calls "the sole definition
of done" — with the Phase-4 gate above: **P4.1** (real-key smoke + Week-1
invoice check) **and** **P4.2** (deploy to `test.beyondkaira.com`) **and** the
**first green CI run** (the
first push to a GitHub remote, which is what first exercises all five CI jobs and
the Playwright e2e). No P5 task starts before those three land. This preamble and
the task list are the *decomposition* deliverable of **P4.6** — planning only.

**How this handles the 2b/2c coupling.** The roadmap says the checker "needs both
[engine depth 2b and Turkish 2c] to be credible." We take the **minimal slice of
each and ruthlessly defer the rest** — we do **not** absorb 2b/2c/2d:

- **2b (engine depth) — minimal slice INCLUDED:** make **Gemini (with search
  grounding) + Perplexity real** (P5.7). A public "show your work" page cannot
  display canned *stub* answers under a "Gemini"/"Perplexity" label — that would
  break the one wedge the checker exists to prove. Per ADR-9 each is a single-file
  swap behind the existing `Provider` protocol, so this is genuinely small.
  **DEFERRED (ships degraded, honestly):** the weighted 0–100 score,
  2-samples-per-prompt, and the sentiment/position extraction pass. The checker
  ships with the **binary** score `footprints / total_responses` — which the
  roadmap itself calls "the honest placeholder until [the weighted score] lands."
  The methodology page (P5.10) says so out loud. These belong to the paid tracking
  pipeline (2b/2d), not the free checker.
- **2c (Turkish) — minimal slice INCLUDED:** a **native** (not translated)
  bilingual fixed prompt set + **Turkish suffix-aware footprint matching with the
  dotted/dotless-i (İ/ı) casefold guard** + Turkish UI copy (P5.8, P5.9). Because
  the checker uses a *fixed* 12-prompt set, "native Turkish prompt generation"
  collapses from an engine into a **curated bilingual list** — a fraction of 2c's
  scope. **DEFERRED:** the full native prompt-*generation* engine and the
  cheap-model extraction validated on a labelled corpus — those exist for the app's
  30–60 site-derived prompts and the weighted score (2c/2d), neither of which the
  binary checker uses. **Hard launch rule:** if a native speaker cannot sign off
  the 12 TR prompts and the casefold fixtures, the checker **launches EN-only** (no
  Turkish beats bad Turkish) — a P5.11 go/no-go condition.
- **Sequencing of the coupling:** the English vertical (P5.1–P5.5) is built and
  proven end-to-end under `DRY_RUN=1` first, so a working checker can go to the 5
  design-partner agencies as a soft preview early. The **loud public launch is
  gated** on real engines (P5.7), Turkish (P5.8/P5.9), the abuse guards (P5.6), and
  the "show our work" methodology page (P5.10) all being done — enforced by P5.11.

**Why KYC is reused as-is (not a synthesized "KYC-lite").** The checker keeps the
existing KYC step rather than skipping it for a brand-derived stub, for two
reasons. (1) It is **zero new code** — the smallest possible diff, the phase's
whole stance. (2) It keeps the **DRY_RUN demo coherent**: the mock KYC returns the
`Yanki Demo Co` profile (aliases include "Yanki") and the mock execution answers
mention "Yanki Demo Co" ~half the time, so footprint matching yields a **meaningful
~0.5 score** — exactly what a design-partner soft preview needs. A KYC-lite whose
aliases are the *real* submitted brand would find nothing in the mock answers
(which still name "Yanki Demo Co") and collapse the DRY_RUN score to ~0. Under
**real** keys the real KYC call returns the real brand's profile, so the displayed
brand is correct at launch; only the $0 DRY_RUN run shows "Yanki Demo Co"
(tech-debt #6, expected). The one extra analysis-model call per uncached check is
negligible against the 48 execution probes it accompanies.

**Everything is $0-first.** Every task is buildable and testable under `DRY_RUN=1`
on the deterministic `MockProvider` (a checker run comes back about "Yanki Demo
Co", tech-debt #6 — fine and expected). Real-key and live steps are isolated into
the one operator-gated task (P5.11), mirroring P4.1/P4.2. Real Gemini/Perplexity
adapters (P5.7) are exercised only via `respx`, never a live call in CI (the P2.2
pattern).

**New ADRs this phase** (design.md ADR log continues from ADR-18; each recorded
when its task lands — numbered by *planned* build order; the independent P5.6/P5.7
may land early, so land order can differ from the numbering): **ADR-19** checker as
a `kind` of analysis (reuse `analyses`) plus the append-only `checker_submissions`
table for per-submit demand + lead capture — P5.1; **ADR-20** `llm_cache` upsert for concurrent-worker safety (repays
tech-debt #9) — P5.2; **ADR-21** competitors computed from the raw answers via a
deterministic proper-noun co-mention heuristic (not `kyc.competitors`, not an LLM
pass) — P5.3; **ADR-22** Postgres-derived rate limiting + daily cost cap +
`CHECKER_ENABLED` kill-switch + salted `ip_hash`, no Redis — P5.6; **ADR-23** real
Gemini/Perplexity providers (supersedes ADR-9 for the checker panel) — P5.7;
**ADR-24** Turkish suffix-aware + İ/ı-casefold footprint matching and the fixed
native TR prompt set — P5.8; **ADR-25** a plain typed i18n dictionary (no
`next-intl`) — P5.9.

### Sequencing & lanes (parallelism map)

Build order is P5.1 → P5.11. After **P5.1** lands the schema + submit endpoint, the
pipeline and frontend lanes run in parallel against the contract; **P5.6**
(hardening) and **P5.7** (real engines) are independent and can run any time;
**P5.8/P5.9** (Turkish) layer onto the green English vertical; **P5.10**
(methodology) renders the version-stamped **EN+TR** prompt module (P5.2/P5.8) and
layers its copy onto the filled TR i18n dict, so it follows **P5.8/P5.9**. **P5.11**
is the strictly-last operator go-live.

| Task | Lane | Depends on | Can parallel with |
|---|---|---|---|
| P5.1 checker submit + leads + 24h reuse | backend-spine | P4.1/P4.2/CI (gate) | — (unblocks the rest) |
| P5.2 checker pipeline branch + fixed EN prompts + cache upsert | pipeline | P5.1 | P5.6, P5.7 |
| P5.3 presence map + competitors (read-time) | backend-spine | P5.1, P5.2 | P5.6, P5.7 |
| P5.4 checker frontend (EN): landing + results | frontend | P5.1, P5.3 | P5.6, P5.7 |
| P5.5 email gate + full-report reveal | frontend | P5.1, P5.4 | P5.6, P5.7 |
| P5.6 hardening: kill-switch + rate limit + cost cap | backend-spine | P5.1 | P5.2, P5.3, P5.4, P5.5, P5.7 |
| P5.7 real Gemini + Perplexity | pipeline | none (gate only) | all |
| P5.8 Turkish prompts + TR footprint matching | pipeline | P5.2 | P5.6, P5.7 |
| P5.9 Turkish UI + i18n | frontend | P5.4, P5.5, P5.8 | P5.6, P5.7 |
| P5.10 methodology page ("show our work") | frontend + infra | P5.2, P5.4, P5.8, P5.9 | P5.6, P5.7 |
| P5.11 operator: live 4-engine smoke + deploy | infra (operator-gated) | all of the above | — |

**Shared-contract merge risks (coordinate before editing):**
- **OpenAPI envelope.** P5.1 (new endpoints/request schemas) and P5.3 (`ResultOut`
  gains nullable `engine_presence` + `competitors_appeared`) both regenerate
  `shared/contracts/openapi.json` → `frontend/lib/types.ts` via `make gen-types`
  (never hand-edited; +lead review). Land P5.1 then P5.3 **before** the frontend
  (P5.4) locks its `contracts.ts` narrowings, or accept one regen.
- **`backend/app/api/routes.py`** is hand-edited by **P5.1** (the two new routes),
  **P5.3** (`_to_out` fills the new result fields), and **P5.6** (submit-handler
  enforcement + IP hashing + kill-switch) — all backend-spine. P5.3 (`_to_out`) and
  P5.6 (the submit handler) touch **different functions**, so parallel edits rarely
  textually collide; still, coordinate/sequence the two if run in parallel (same
  lane, one owner) to keep this shared file merge-clean.
- **The `analyses` model + the one new Alembic migration** is owned by
  **backend-spine** (P5.1). It adds *only nullable* columns (+extra-sensitive
  `alembic/**` review). `ip_hash` lands in P5.1's migration so P5.6 is pure logic
  with **no** second migration; the pipeline lane reads `analysis.kind` but must
  not alter the migration.
- **`runner.py` kind-branch stays in the pipeline lane (P5.2).** The worker
  (`app/worker.py`, backend-spine) calls `run_pipeline` **unchanged** — the
  `kind`-branch lives inside `run_pipeline`, so there is **no** worker-dispatch seam
  and no separate `checker_runner` (deliberately more minimal than a parallel
  runner). P5.2 only reads P5.1's `kind` column; sequence P5.1 → P5.2. **P5.8**
  later edits the same file only to thread `analysis.lang` into the footprint step
  (same pipeline lane; sequence P5.2 → P5.8).
- **`checker_prompts.py`** (fixed set, `VERSION`-stamped) is edited by P5.2 (EN)
  then P5.8 (TR) — same lane (pipeline), sequence them. P5.10 renders from a
  generated JSON export of this same module (via `make gen-types`), never a
  hand-copy.
- **`footprint.py`** is edited only by P5.8 (TR suffix + İ/ı casefold). P5.3's
  summary helper does **not** import it (presence uses the already-stored
  `footprint` booleans; competitors use their own proper-noun scan), so P5.3 and
  P5.8 do not collide.
- **Config env vars** bind all lanes; the new vars (below) are added to
  `app/config.py` **and** `deploy/.env.example` in the task that introduces them.
- **`deploy/.env.example` is infra-owned and extra-sensitive (lead review).**
  P5.1, P5.6, and P5.7 each append vars to it — every such edit gets the infra
  lane's review. Likewise `app/config.py` is backend-spine-owned: P5.7 (pipeline
  lane) adding its two keys coordinates with the spine owner.
- **`Makefile` + `scripts/**` are infra-owned.** P5.10's generator
  (`scripts/gen_methodology.py`) and its `make gen-types`/CI wiring are the
  **infra half** of that task; the frontend half only renders the generated
  artifact. Run P5.10 as one agent granted both ownerships or split the halves —
  and the same task reconciles design.md §2's "two files are produced by
  `make gen-types`" statement to name the third generated artifact.
- **`CHECKER_ENABLED` defaults to `0`** (P5.6). `deploy/.env.example` ships it `0`
  (prod stays dark); local dev and the CI e2e job set `CHECKER_ENABLED=1`; the
  operator flips prod to `1` at go-live (P5.11).
- **`lib/i18n.ts`** is scaffolded (EN) by P5.4, filled (TR) by P5.9, then extended
  with the methodology copy keys by P5.10 — all frontend-lane, sequence
  **P5.4 → P5.9 → P5.10** (P5.10 also **writes** it, so it is not merely a reader).

**New env vars introduced this phase** (all with safe defaults; declared in
`app/config.py` and `deploy/.env.example` — one var, one place — when their task
lands):
`CHECKER_RESULT_CACHE_HOURS=24` (P5.1); `CHECKER_ENABLED=0`,
`CHECKER_RATE_LIMIT_PER_IP_HOUR=5`, `CHECKER_RATE_LIMIT_PER_BRAND_DAY=3`,
`CHECKER_DAILY_USD_CAP=50`, `RATE_LIMIT_SALT` (P5.6); `GEMINI_API_KEY` +
`PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` (P5.7, blank under `DRY_RUN`). The fixed prompt set is a
constant **12** (not a knob); 12 × 4 engines = 48 responses ≤ the existing
`MAX_RESPONSES_PER_JOB=60`, so no cap change is needed.

---

### P5.1 — Checker submit endpoint + lead capture + per-brand 24h reuse
- **Goal:** the checker's API surface, reusing the `analyses` table. One Alembic
  migration (a) adds **nullable** columns to `analyses` (`kind` default `'mvp'`,
  `brand`, `category`, `lang` default `'en'`) and (b) creates the append-only
  **`checker_submissions`** table (`id`, `analysis_id` FK, `ip_hash` nullable,
  `lang`, `email` nullable, `created_at`) — one row per accepted checker submit,
  because the 24h cache shares one `analyses` row across visitors and leads/demand
  must be counted per submit. New `POST /api/v1/checker {brand, category, lang}` →
  validates; every accepted submit **inserts a `checker_submissions` row** (the
  demand signal, cache hits included); if a `done`
  checker analysis with the same normalized `(brand, category, lang)` exists and is
  younger than `CHECKER_RESULT_CACHE_HOURS` (24) it **returns that analysis id**
  (instant, $0 — the draft's "results cached 24h per brand" abuse mitigation);
  otherwise it inserts a `kind='checker'` row `status='queued'`. Either way it
  returns **202 `{id, submission_id}`**.
  Because `analyses.url` is an existing MVP column with a `NOT NULL` constraint we
  deliberately do **not** alter (the migration stays *nullable-columns-only*), a
  checker row — which has no crawl target — stores a **deterministic synthetic**
  `url` (`f"checker://{normalized_brand}/{category}"`) in `create_checker_analysis`,
  so the insert satisfies the constraint with **no** schema/constraint change and no
  MVP-column mutation under the `alembic/**` review. New
  `POST /api/v1/checker/leads {submission_id, email}` sets `email` on **that
  submission row** (the email gate) — append-only, so two visitors served the same
  cached analysis each keep their own lead; a shared row never loses an email to an
  overwrite. `ip_hash` stays null here (populated in P5.6,
  which owns the salt); the column lands now so P5.6 needs no second migration.
  Results are polled through the **existing** `GET /api/v1/analyses/{id}` (works for
  checker rows unchanged).
- **Why now:** it is the foundation every other P5 task builds on and the contract
  the pipeline + frontend lanes code against in parallel.
- **Dependencies:** the P5 build gate (P4.1 + P4.2 + first green CI).
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** `backend/alembic/versions/<rev>_checker_fields.py` (migration
  #2: nullable `analyses` columns + the `checker_submissions` table),
  `backend/app/db/models.py`, `backend/app/api/schemas.py`
  (`CheckerSubmitRequest`, `CheckerSubmitResponse`, `CheckerLeadRequest`),
  `backend/app/api/routes.py` (two routes), `backend/app/services/analyses.py`
  (`create_checker_analysis` with 24h reuse + per-submit recording, `attach_lead`),
  `backend/app/config.py`
  (`checker_result_cache_hours`), `deploy/.env.example`
  (`CHECKER_RESULT_CACHE_HOURS=24`; infra-owned — lead review), regenerated
  `shared/contracts/openapi.json`
  + `frontend/lib/types.ts` (via `make gen-types`), ADR-19 recorded in
  [design.md](design.md), `backend/tests/test_checker_api.py`.
- **Acceptance:** `POST /api/v1/checker` with a non-empty brand+category → `202`
  `{id, submission_id}` and the row has `kind='checker'` with a non-null synthetic
  `url` (the
  existing `NOT NULL` constraint satisfied, migration still additive-only);
  a blank brand → `422` and records nothing; a repeat submit
  within 24h returns the **same** analysis id with **no** new `analyses` row but a
  **new** `checker_submissions` row (assert analyses count unchanged, submissions
  count +1 — cache hits still count as demand); two **different** emails submitted
  via `POST /api/v1/checker/leads` against two submissions of the **same** cached
  analysis both persist and are both retrievable (no overwrite); existing MVP
  `POST /api/v1/analyses` behaviour is unchanged (defaults preserve `kind='mvp'`);
  `make gen-types` produces no drift after commit; `make test` green (DRY_RUN, $0).
- **Status:** todo

### P5.2 — Checker pipeline branch: seed KYC + versioned fixed 12-prompt set (EN)
- **Goal:** teach the runner to walk the *same six steps* for a checker row without
  a crawl. In `run_pipeline`, branch on `analysis.kind`: for `'checker'`, step 1
  ("discovery") builds a seed string (`f"Brand: {brand}. Category: {category}."`)
  instead of `discovery.discover(url)` — keeping `current_step='discovery'`,
  `progress=15`, so the locked progress mapping and `StepProgress` contract are
  untouched — then KYC (step 2) runs **as-is** on the seed. Step 3 uses a **fixed,
  `VERSION`-stamped** bilingual 12-prompt set (`checker_prompts.generate(kyc, lang)`,
  English wired here; Turkish added in P5.8) instead of the templated `PROMPT_COUNT`
  generator. Steps 4–6 (execute, footprint, scoring) run unchanged. Also make
  `execute._write_cache` an **upsert** (`INSERT … ON CONFLICT (cache_key) DO
  NOTHING`, then re-read) so the public checker is safe with more than one worker
  (repays tech-debt #9; SQLite supports `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`).
- **Why now:** it turns the existing loop into the checker loop with the smallest
  possible diff; the whole English vertical is DRY_RUN-green once this lands.
- **Dependencies:** P5.1 (`kind`/`brand`/`category`/`lang` columns).
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** `backend/app/pipeline/checker_prompts.py` (fixed EN set of 12,
  keyed by `lang`, carrying a module `VERSION` constant),
  `backend/app/pipeline/runner.py` (kind branch),
  `backend/app/pipeline/execute.py` (upsert),
  `backend/tests/pipeline/test_checker_prompts.py`,
  `backend/tests/pipeline/test_checker_pipeline.py`,
  `backend/tests/pipeline/test_execute_race.py` (Postgres-only concurrent-write
  test, gated like `test_queue_postgres.py`); tech-debt.md #9 marked repaid;
  ADR-20 recorded in [design.md](design.md).
- **Acceptance:** a `kind='checker'` analysis under `DRY_RUN=1` walks all six steps
  with **no** HTTP crawl, produces exactly **12** prompts and **48** responses
  (12 × 4 mock engines) ≤ `MAX_RESPONSES_PER_JOB`, lands `done` at `progress=100`
  with a meaningful non-zero `geo_score` and no divide-by-zero; `generate(kyc,'en')`
  returns 12 non-empty, category-tagged, unique prompts and is byte-stable across
  runs (version-stamped); a stale-claim re-run is idempotent (no doubled rows); two
  workers inserting the same `cache_key` at once both succeed with no `IntegrityError`.
  `make test` green.
- **Status:** todo

### P5.3 — Engine-presence map + competitors-that-showed-up (read-time aggregation)
- **Goal:** surface the two checker-only results the draft promises, computed at
  read time from rows we already store — no new column, no pipeline change. A pure
  helper `services/checker_summary.py` takes the analysis' `responses` + `kyc` and
  returns `engine_presence` (per engine: mentioned count / total, derived from the
  existing `footprint` booleans) and `competitors_appeared` — a deterministic
  **proper-noun co-mention heuristic over the raw answers**: scan each answer for
  Title-Case brand tokens, **exclude** the searched brand + `kyc.aliases` + a small
  EN/TR stoplist, count frequency across answers, return the top names with their
  mention counts. This captures "brands that showed up" faithfully and at **$0** —
  it does **not** intersect against `kyc.competitors` (which would miss brands the
  KYC list never knew) and it makes no LLM call. `ResultOut` gains nullable
  `engine_presence` + `competitors_appeared`; `_to_out` populates them only for
  `kind='checker'` rows (null for MVP analyses).
- **Why now:** these are core free-tier deliverables of 2a ("engine-by-engine
  presence map + competitors that showed up") and they compose from data the
  pipeline already writes, so no worker change is needed.
- **Dependencies:** P5.1 (contract), P5.2 (checker rows to aggregate).
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** `backend/app/services/checker_summary.py`,
  `backend/app/api/schemas.py` (`ResultOut` additions + `EnginePresence`,
  `CompetitorMention` models), `backend/app/api/routes.py` (`_to_out` fills them for
  checker rows), regenerated `shared/contracts/openapi.json` +
  `frontend/lib/types.ts`, ADR-21 recorded in [design.md](design.md),
  `backend/tests/test_checker_summary.py`.
- **Acceptance:** for a DRY_RUN checker analysis, `GET` returns `engine_presence`
  with one entry per panel engine whose counts sum-consistently with
  `total_responses`, and `competitors_appeared` listing the mock filler brands the
  answers name (**Acme, Globex, Initech, Umbrella, Stark**) — with the searched
  brand and its aliases excluded — derived from the answers alone, **not** from
  `kyc.competitors`; for an MVP (`kind='mvp'`) analysis both fields are `null`; the
  helper is pure and unit-tested; no `gen-types` drift.
- **Status:** todo

### P5.4 — Checker frontend: bilingual-ready landing + live results (EN)
- **Goal:** the public checker screens, reusing the existing components. A new
  `/checker` route with a `CheckerForm` (brand + category inputs + an EN/TR language
  toggle; English strings wired, Turkish filled in P5.9) that calls a new
  `createCheckerAnalysis()` and routes to `/checker/[id]` (carrying the response's
  `submission_id` as a query param — P5.5's email gate posts against it). That
  results route polls
  the **existing** `getAnalysis(id)` and renders: the reused `StepProgress` while
  running (checker step copy may be relabeled — the `current_step` values are
  unchanged), then the reused `ScoreGauge`, a new `EnginePresenceMap`, a new
  `CompetitorsList`, and the raw answers (all answers shown here; the email gate that
  hides all-but-one lands in P5.5). A lightweight `lib/i18n.ts` dictionary (English
  now; a plain typed dict, not `next-intl`) backs the copy. All new components use
  [frontend-brandkit.md](frontend-brandkit.md) §2 tokens and honour §7 (never
  color-only, `aria-live` on the polling status, ≥40px targets, reduced-motion).
- **Why now:** stands up the English vertical so the whole checker runs end-to-end
  under a DRY_RUN stack and can preview to design partners before the loud launch.
- **Dependencies:** P5.1 (endpoints), P5.3 (result fields in the contract).
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** `frontend/app/checker/page.tsx`,
  `frontend/app/checker/[id]/page.tsx`,
  `frontend/components/{CheckerForm,EnginePresenceMap,CompetitorsList}.tsx`,
  `frontend/lib/i18n.ts` (EN dict + empty `tr` placeholder), `frontend/lib/api.ts`
  (`createCheckerAnalysis`), `frontend/lib/contracts.ts` (friendly types +
  narrowings for the new fields), `frontend/tests/CheckerForm.test.tsx`,
  `frontend/tests/checker.a11y.test.tsx`.
- **Acceptance:** against a running `DRY_RUN=1` stack, submitting a brand+category
  navigates to a live progress screen that resolves into a score + presence map +
  competitors + the raw answers; blank/invalid brand is rejected client-side (no
  submit fires); the checker screens pass the axe smoke suite (no critical
  violations) per [frontend-brandkit.md](frontend-brandkit.md) §7;
  `npm test -- --run` green.
- **Status:** todo

### P5.5 — Email gate + full-report reveal
- **Goal:** the checker's lead-capture conversion — the free view shows the score +
  presence map + competitors + **one** full raw answer; the rest of the answers sit
  behind an `EmailGate`. On email submit it POSTs `{submission_id, email}` to
  `/api/v1/checker/leads`
  (P5.1) — the `submission_id` from the submit response is carried to the results
  route (query param) — stores the email on that submission, and reveals all
  answers in place. The one free answer
  defaults to the first answer that mentions the brand (falls back to the first
  answer). Clear consent copy; success/error/loading states; a keyboard-accessible,
  labelled input with an inline `danger` message on an invalid email (never an alert
  box); locale-aware so P5.9 can fill TR.
- **Why now:** "the full report costs an email address" is the entire lead-magnet
  mechanic (roadmap 2a; the first-90-days target of 600 signups from 3000 runs);
  splitting it from P5.4 keeps both tasks genuinely one-session-sized.
- **Dependencies:** P5.1 (leads endpoint), P5.4 (results screen to gate).
- **Complexity:** S
- **Deliverables:** `frontend/components/EmailGate.tsx`,
  `frontend/app/checker/[id]/page.tsx` (gate wiring + one-free-answer selection),
  `frontend/lib/api.ts` (`submitLead`), `frontend/tests/EmailGate.test.tsx`,
  `frontend/tests/EmailGate.a11y.test.tsx`.
- **Acceptance:** against a `DRY_RUN=1` stack, before submit the full answer set is
  hidden behind the gate and exactly one full answer is shown; a valid email reveals
  the rest and stores it (that submission row's `email` is set — a second visitor's
  email on the same cached analysis persists alongside, never overwrites); an
  invalid email shows an
  inline error and reveals nothing; the gate is keyboard-operable with a visible
  focus ring and a ≥40px target; axe smoke passes; `npm test -- --run` green.
- **Status:** todo

### P5.6 — Public hardening: kill-switch + per-IP & per-brand rate limit + daily cost cap
- **Goal:** make the anonymous endpoint safe to expose — the blocker called out in
  tech-debt #5, required "before any public URL." All Postgres-backed, no new infra.
  (a) A `CHECKER_ENABLED` master **kill-switch** (default `0`): while off,
  `POST /api/v1/checker` returns a friendly parked **503** and enqueues nothing
  (cached-brand hits from P5.1 still return, since they cost nothing) — the public
  surface stays dark in every environment until the operator flips it at P5.11.
  (b) A `services/rate_limit.py` counts this request's **`ip_hash`** rows in
  `checker_submissions` over the last hour and rejects over
  `CHECKER_RATE_LIMIT_PER_IP_HOUR`
  with a **429**, and counts *fresh runs* (new `kind='checker'` rows) of this
  normalized `(brand, category,
  lang)` in the last day and rejects over `CHECKER_RATE_LIMIT_PER_BRAND_DAY` with a
  **429** (a single hot brand hammered from many IPs). (c) It sums today's checker
  `responses.cost_usd` and, over `CHECKER_DAILY_USD_CAP`, refuses new *runs* with a
  friendly "the free checker is at capacity today" **503** (the draft's "daily cost
  check"). `POST /api/v1/checker` derives `ip_hash = sha256(RATE_LIMIT_SALT +
  X-Forwarded-For client IP)` into `checker_submissions.ip_hash`
  (privacy-preserving behind
  the shared Caddy) and enforces all guards before enqueuing.
- **Why now:** hard prerequisite for a public URL with real keys; a public,
  anonymous, LLM-spending endpoint without these is an open cost/abuse hole.
- **Dependencies:** P5.1 (`ip_hash` column; the submit route).
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** `backend/app/services/rate_limit.py`,
  `backend/app/api/routes.py` (enforcement + IP hashing + kill-switch guard),
  `backend/app/config.py` (`checker_enabled`, `checker_rate_limit_per_ip_hour`,
  `checker_rate_limit_per_brand_day`, `checker_daily_usd_cap`, `rate_limit_salt`),
  `deploy/.env.example` (all five vars; `CHECKER_ENABLED=0`), ADR-22 recorded in
  [design.md](design.md); tech-debt.md #5 marked repaid;
  `backend/tests/test_checker_ratelimit.py`.
- **Acceptance:** with `CHECKER_ENABLED=0` a fresh submit → `503` parked and
  nothing recorded, while a 24h cached-brand submit still returns its id; with it
  `=1`, the
  `(limit+1)`-th submit from one `ip_hash` within the hour → `429`, and the
  `(limit+1)`-th distinct submit of one brand within the day → `429` (a
  cache-served repeat does **not** count); once summed checker cost exceeds a
  (monkeypatched-low) daily cap, a fresh brand+category submit → `503` while a 24h
  cached-brand submit still `202`s the existing id; `ip_hash` is a salted hash, never
  the raw IP; under `DRY_RUN` all costs are `0` so the cap never trips by default;
  `make test` green.
- **Status:** todo

### P5.7 — Make Gemini + Perplexity real (the minimal 2b slice)
- **Goal:** replace the two **stub** providers with real adapters so the public
  panel shows four *real* engines — Gemini via the Google SDK **with search
  grounding** (it also stands in for Google until AIO tracking, roadmap 2b/Later),
  Perplexity via its API — each still satisfying the existing `Provider` protocol,
  with `cost_usd` from a pinned price-table constant. `DRY_RUN` is unaffected (still
  four mocks); real adapters are exercised **only** under `respx`, never a live call
  in CI (the P2.2 pattern). This is the *only* 2b work in Phase 5 — weighted score,
  2-samples, and sentiment/position stay deferred (the checker ships the honest
  binary score).
- **Why now:** a "show your work" page cannot display canned stub text under a real
  engine's name; four credible engines is the checker's headline promise vs
  Semrush. Per ADR-9 this is a single-file swap per engine.
- **Dependencies:** none beyond the P5 gate (pure providers lane); land any time.
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** `backend/app/providers/gemini_provider.py` +
  `backend/app/providers/perplexity_provider.py` (real, replacing the stubs),
  `backend/app/providers/registry.py` (wire real when `DRY_RUN=0`),
  `backend/app/config.py` (`gemini_api_key`, `perplexity_api_key`),
  `deploy/.env.example` (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`, blank in DRY_RUN),
  ADR-23 recorded in [design.md](design.md),
  `backend/tests/pipeline/test_gemini_provider.py` +
  `test_perplexity_provider.py` (respx).
- **Acceptance:** each adapter satisfies the `Provider` protocol and passes a respx
  request/response-shape test with a computed non-zero `cost_usd`; grounding is
  enabled on the Gemini call; `DRY_RUN=1` still returns four mocks and CI makes
  **no** live provider call; `make test`/`make typecheck` green.
- **Status:** todo

### P5.8 — Turkish: native fixed prompts + suffix-aware + İ/ı-casefold footprint matching
- **Goal:** the credibility half of Turkish (2c minimal slice). Add a **native**
  (not translated) Turkish 12-prompt set to `checker_prompts.py`, selected by
  `lang='tr'` and carrying the same `VERSION` stamp + a `# NATIVE — native-speaker
  sign-off required before launch` marker. Add Turkish matching to `footprint.py`,
  gated on the run's `lang`/locale so English behaviour is byte-unchanged. Because
  the current `detect(raw_text, kyc)` signature and the `KYC` model carry **no**
  language, `detect` gains a `lang` parameter (default `'en'`) threaded from
  `analysis.lang` at its `runner.py` footprint-step call site (the checker branch
  from P5.2, same pipeline lane); `architecture.md` §2's
  `footprint.detect(raw_text, kyc)` note is reconciled in P5.11's docs pass. The two
  `lang`-gated rules: (a) the
  **dotted/dotless-i casefold** (İ/i and I/ı — the classic Turkish `.lower()` trap
  that corrupts a brand), and (b) **suffix-aware** brand/alias matching (Turkish
  agglutination — *Marka'nın*, *Markayı*, *Markada*, *Markadan* — breaks the current
  `\b`-anchored match). Validate against a small **labelled Turkish fixture** (the
  brandkit `# TODO(pipeline)` on `footprint.py`).
- **Why now:** the roadmap is emphatic that Turkish ships *at checker launch* and
  "is not the corner we cut" — wrong Turkish numbers kill the differentiation story.
  Fixed prompts make this a curated list + a matching rule, not a generation engine.
- **Dependencies:** P5.2 (the fixed-prompt module + checker branch to extend).
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** `backend/app/pipeline/checker_prompts.py` (native TR set),
  `backend/app/pipeline/footprint.py` (TR casefold + suffix matching, gated on a new
  `lang` param), `backend/app/pipeline/runner.py` (thread `analysis.lang` into the
  footprint step; sequences after P5.2's kind-branch, same pipeline lane),
  ADR-24 recorded in [design.md](design.md),
  `backend/tests/pipeline/test_footprint_tr.py` (labelled TR precision fixture, incl.
  İ/ı cases), `backend/tests/pipeline/test_checker_prompts.py` (TR case).
- **Acceptance:** `generate(kyc, 'tr')` returns 12 non-empty native-Turkish prompts,
  version-stamped and byte-stable; the labelled fixture asserts a Turkish brand is
  matched with common suffixes and apostrophe forms, that the İ/ı casefold does not
  corrupt matches, and that unrelated tokens do **not** match; **all existing
  English `footprint` tests stay green**; `make test` green under `DRY_RUN`.
- **Status:** todo

### P5.9 — Turkish UI + i18n wiring
- **Goal:** make the checker screens speak Turkish. Fill the `tr` dictionary in
  `lib/i18n.ts` with **native** copy (seeded from
  [frontend-brandkit.md](frontend-brandkit.md) §6, pending a native-speaker
  sign-off), wire the EN/TR toggle so every string on the landing, progress,
  results, and email-gate screens switches, and pass `lang` through to
  `createCheckerAnalysis`. No new dependency — the plain typed dictionary from P5.4.
- **Why now:** completes the Turkish launch requirement on the UI side; pairs with
  P5.8 so the public checker is genuinely bilingual before the loud launch.
- **Dependencies:** P5.4 (checker screens + i18n scaffold), P5.5 (email-gate copy),
  P5.8 (TR prompts, so a TR run produces sensible results).
- **Complexity:** S
- **Deliverables:** `frontend/lib/i18n.ts` (native TR dict),
  `frontend/app/checker/**` + `frontend/components/EmailGate.tsx` (toggle wiring),
  ADR-25 recorded in [design.md](design.md),
  `frontend/tests/checker-i18n.test.tsx`.
- **Acceptance:** toggling to Turkish renders all checker copy in Turkish (no
  English leakage, no untranslated keys) and a TR submit produces a TR-language run;
  the toggle is keyboard-accessible and axe-clean; `npm test -- --run` green.
  (Native-speaker sign-off is an operator step tracked in P5.11's launch gate.)
- **Status:** todo

### P5.10 — Public methodology page ("show our work")
- **Goal:** the transparency wedge as a public asset. A `/methodology` page
  publishing the **12 fixed prompts** (EN + TR), the **four engines**, the **score
  formula** (`footprints / total_responses`, shown), and honest caveats: single
  sample today, binary score with the weighted 0–100 version coming, the Turkish
  matching approach and its limits. It renders the exact live prompts from a
  build-time JSON artifact **generated from** the same **version-stamped**
  `checker_prompts` module the runner reads (P5.2/P5.8) — never a hand-copy — so the
  published methodology can never drift from what actually runs. Linked from the
  checker page.
- **Why now:** roadmap 2a promises "show our work from the first touch — not a
  teaser," and the draft makes the public methodology page a headline checker
  feature and a Product-Hunt/comparison-page talking point; it is cheap (a static
  read of a generated artifact) and on-wedge.
- **Dependencies:** P5.2 **and P5.8** (the version-stamped EN+TR prompt module — the
  TR prompts come from P5.8 and are required for the both-languages render), P5.4
  (route shell + i18n seam), **P5.9** (the filled TR `i18n.ts` dict — P5.10's
  methodology copy keys layer on top, so sequence P5.9 → P5.10 to avoid an
  `i18n.ts` write collision).
- **Complexity:** S
- **Deliverables:** *(frontend half)* `frontend/app/methodology/page.tsx`,
  `frontend/lib/i18n.ts` additions, a link from `/checker`,
  `frontend/tests/methodology.test.tsx` + `methodology.a11y.test.tsx`;
  *(infra half — `scripts/**` and the `Makefile` are infra-owned, see the
  merge-risks note)* `scripts/gen_methodology.py`, the `Makefile` `gen-types`
  target wiring (+ the CI contract-drift gate picking the new artifact up), and
  `shared/contracts/checker_methodology.json` (the version-stamped fixed prompts
  **EN+TR** + score-formula/engine metadata, exported **from the `checker_prompts`
  source** so the current
  OpenAPI drift gate also guards it — a generated artifact, **never** a hand-copy;
  +lead review on `shared/contracts/**`), which the page imports at build time —
  this keeps the locked **two**-endpoint count (no new HTTP route) and mirrors the
  `openapi.json` → `types.ts` precedent from P3.1 (no frontend-lane edit of
  spine-owned `routes.py`); plus a one-line reconciliation of design.md §2's
  "two files are produced by `make gen-types`" statement (now three artifacts).
- **Acceptance:** the page renders the exact live 12 prompts (read from the
  generated `checker_methodology.json`, not a hand-copy — a prompt edit re-exported
  via `make gen-types` shows up here with **no** second edit), the formula, the
  engine list, and the stated limitations, in both languages; `make gen-types`
  produces no drift; it is axe-clean and reachable from `/checker`;
  `npm test -- --run` green.
- **Status:** todo

### P5.11 — Operator-gated: live 4-engine smoke, cost soak, deploy, launch gate
- **Goal:** the one live/real-key task, mirroring P4.1 + P4.2. With `DRY_RUN=0` and
  all four real keys (Anthropic + OpenAI + the new Gemini + Perplexity), run a real
  checker analysis and confirm four engines answer, footprints, the presence map,
  competitors-appeared, and a score; **capture the per-checker-run cost** and check
  it against `CHECKER_DAILY_USD_CAP` and the pricing model (feeds the roadmap 2d
  pricing decision). Verify the kill-switch, both rate limits, and the daily cost cap
  fire live. Redeploy the existing stack to `test.beyondkaira.com` (the `/checker` +
  `/methodology` + `/api/v1/checker*` routes need **no** Caddy change — the shared
  Caddy already path-routes `/api/*` → api and everything else → web), then flip
  `CHECKER_ENABLED=1`. Add a `DRY_RUN=1` checker-happy-path e2e job to CI. The
  **loud public launch** (Product Hunt / LinkedIn) is the go/no-go gated here on:
  real engines green, the abuse guards verified live, the methodology page live, and
  **Turkish signed off by a native speaker — or the checker launches EN-only** ("no
  Turkish beats bad Turkish"). The EN-only path is a **deliberate,
  operator-authorized deviation** from the frozen roadmap **2a** "Turkish at checker
  launch (not a later add)" mandate — invoked **only** with a **named** operator
  sign-off and recorded as a deviation; the **default/primary path is bilingual at
  launch** (P5.8/P5.9 build it, so the fallback is a last resort, not the plan).
- **Why now:** cost, live-provider behaviour, and the launch decision are the only
  things `DRY_RUN` cannot prove; isolating them keeps every other task $0.
- **Dependencies:** P5.1–P5.10 all done; P4.2 deploy scripts proven.
- **Complexity:** M
- **Deliverables:** a cost + soak note (session summary / private feasibility doc),
  a `checker` e2e job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, a redeploy verification, the
  recorded per-run cost, a **documented demand-test metrics query** reading from
  `checker_submissions` (total demand = `count(*)` of submissions, cache-served
  hits included; fresh runs = `count(*)` of `kind='checker'` analyses; run→email
  conversion = `count(DISTINCT email)/count(*)` over submissions — per-submit
  recording means hot cached brands neither undercount demand nor lose leads; still
  a plain `count()/sum()` read, no new
  endpoint), and the docs reconciliation (architecture.md checker data-flow, roadmap
  2a status, tech-debt #5/#9 closed); no new product code unless a bug surfaces.
- **Acceptance:** a real four-engine checker run completes within the caps with no
  secret committed; the measured per-run cost **and** the demand-test metrics query
  (runs + run→email conversion) are recorded; kill-switch, both rate limits, and the
  daily cap observed firing live; `https://test.beyondkaira.com/checker`
  serves the loop and `/methodology` is reachable; the `DRY_RUN` checker e2e is green
  in CI; the launch go/no-go is recorded with the Turkish sign-off (or the
  named-operator-authorized EN-only deviation) attached.
- **Status:** todo

---

### Phase-5 assumptions
- **Reusing `analyses` for checker rows is the right call** (a `kind` column, not a
  new `checker_analyses` table): the checker walks the identical queue + six-step
  lifecycle, so a parallel table would duplicate the worker, the GET envelope, and
  every model. Recorded as **ADR-19** when built.
- **The worker needs no dispatch change.** The `kind`-branch lives inside
  `run_pipeline` (pipeline lane), so `app/worker.py` calls it unchanged — no
  separate `checker_runner`, no worker seam. This is deliberately more minimal than
  a parallel runner and removes a backend-spine ↔ pipeline merge risk.
- **KYC is reused as-is, not synthesized.** Running the existing KYC step on the
  seed string is zero new code and keeps the DRY_RUN score coherent (~0.5, about
  "Yanki Demo Co" per tech-debt #6); the real brand is shown under real keys. A
  brand-derived "KYC-lite" was rejected (see the preamble) because under DRY_RUN it
  collapses the score to ~0.
- **Lead capture and demand counting are per-submit, not per-analysis-row.** The
  append-only `checker_submissions` table exists because the 24h cache shares one
  `analyses` row across many visitors: a single `analyses.email` column would let
  visitor B's email overwrite visitor A's on a hot cached brand (losing exactly
  the leads the checker exists to capture), and `count(*)` over `analyses` would
  miss every cache-served demand signal. One submission row per accepted submit
  (email nullable until the gate is filled) fixes both; the lead list is
  `SELECT email FROM checker_submissions WHERE email IS NOT NULL`. Richer lead
  metadata (consent flags, dedupe) can be added to this table later if marketing
  needs it.
- **Competitors are computed from the raw answers**, via a deterministic Title-Case
  proper-noun co-mention heuristic (brand + aliases excluded, stoplist-filtered),
  **not** from `kyc.competitors` and **not** via an LLM pass. This is $0,
  deterministic, and faithful to "brands that showed up" (it surfaces brands the KYC
  list never knew). Recorded as **ADR-21**.
- **Checker KYC leans on model world-knowledge**, not a crawl: with only
  brand+category as seed text, the KYC call infers aliases from what the model knows
  about the brand. Acceptable for a free checker, and the "show your work" ethos
  means we display exactly what came back.
- **One worker suffices for the demand-test volume** (~3000 runs / 90 days ≈ 33/day);
  the `llm_cache` upsert (P5.2) removes the tech-debt #9 race so a second worker can
  be added later with no code change.
- **`ip_hash` is a salted hash of the `X-Forwarded-For` client IP** (privacy behind
  the shared Caddy), stored instead of a raw IP; the salt (`RATE_LIMIT_SALT`) is a
  new env var.
- **`CHECKER_ENABLED` defaults to `0`** — the public route is dark in every
  environment (`deploy/.env.example` ships `0`) until the operator flips it at
  P5.11; local dev and the CI e2e job set it `1`.
- **A plain typed i18n dictionary** (no `next-intl`) is enough for a two-language,
  handful-of-screens surface — fewer moving parts. Recorded as **ADR-25**.
- **12 fixed prompts × 4 engines = 48 responses** fits under the existing
  `MAX_RESPONSES_PER_JOB=60`, so no cost-cap or queue change is needed; **12** is a
  constant, not a configurable knob.
- **The binary score is an acceptable, honest ship for the free checker** — the
  weighted 0–100 score (2b) is deferred and the methodology page (P5.10) says so.
- **The fixed prompt sets are version-stamped** so the runner and the methodology
  page read one identical, published source.

### Phase-5 open questions (operator input wanted)
- **Native Turkish prompts + copy need a native-speaker sign-off** before the loud
  launch (brandkit §6 / roadmap 2c risk). **Who signs off — and who is the named
  operator authorized to invoke the EN-only fallback?** Resolve this owner **early**
  so the primary path (bilingual at launch) stays the default. Confirmed launch
  rule: if no sign-off by go-live, the checker launches **EN-only** — a **deliberate,
  recorded deviation** from the frozen roadmap 2a "Turkish at checker launch (not a
  later add)" mandate — and Turkish follows once signed off (P5.8/P5.9 build it;
  P5.11 gates the launch on it).
- **Default abuse thresholds are guesses:** `CHECKER_RATE_LIMIT_PER_IP_HOUR=5`,
  `CHECKER_RATE_LIMIT_PER_BRAND_DAY=3`, and `CHECKER_DAILY_USD_CAP=50` — the real
  numbers come from P5.11's Week-1 cost read and the pricing decision. Product to
  confirm the free-tier generosity vs spend.
- **Behind-proxy client IP:** rate limiting keys on a salted hash of the client IP;
  behind the shared Caddy the real client IP arrives via `X-Forwarded-For` — confirm
  the trusted-proxy handling so the hash keys on the visitor, not the proxy, and is
  spoof-resistant enough for per-IP limiting. (Infra detail for P5.6/P5.11.)
- **Which brand gets the "≥1 full raw answer" shown free** — defaulting to the first
  answer that mentions the brand (falling back to the first answer) unless product
  prefers a "best" one. Affects the `EmailGate` framing in P5.5.
- **Competitor precision on real answers:** the deterministic proper-noun heuristic
  is $0 and faithful on the mock, but can be noisy on real answers. If it proves
  thin/noisy after P5.11's read, the fallback is one cheap "extract the brands
  mentioned" LLM pass (pulling a small slice of 2b's extraction forward) — deferred
  unless the data demands it.
- **Where the checker lives / email gate strength / captcha:** `/checker` on the
  same origin is assumed; a single unverified email is assumed for max lead capture
  (weakest abuse control). Whether to add email verification, disposable-domain
  blocking, or a lightweight proof-of-work/captcha before go-live is a product/abuse
  trade-off to confirm at P5.11.
- **Grounding cost/ToS:** Gemini search grounding and Perplexity live-search add
  cost and have ToS constraints (the draft flags a "ToS review for all 4 APIs");
  confirm grounding is on and compliant before P5.7's live path runs in P5.11.

## Technical debt & assumptions (living list)

Keep this honest — see [design.md](design.md) ADR log for the "why" behind
decisions.

- **Deploy/rollback scripts are UNTESTED** until P4.2. Marked so in README.
- **Gemini + Perplexity are stubs** (planned — roadmap 2b), not a shortcut to hide.
- **Prompt generation is templated, not LLM** (deliberate — testable + free;
  roadmap 2d LLM prompt engine supersedes).
- **`llm_cache` is within-job only** for the MVP; the cross-account cache (the real
  cost lever) is roadmap 2d.
- **Real-key cost is unvalidated** until P4.1 — the biggest open risk to the
  pricing story.
- **Assumption:** SQLite covers unit tests and Postgres covers queue/jsonb
  tests; if a model needs a Postgres-only type in a hot path, revisit P1.2.
