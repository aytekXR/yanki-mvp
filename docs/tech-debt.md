# Technical Debt — living list

*Per [session-rules.md](session-rules.md): shortcuts are fine, hidden shortcuts
are not. Every session appends here and removes what it repays. Ordered
roughly by risk.*

Last updated: 2026-07-10 (P5.6: **item 21 REPAID** — `POST /api/v1/checker` now
carries a salted `ip_hash`, a default-OFF `CHECKER_ENABLED` kill-switch, per-IP
and per-brand rate limits, and a rolling-24h daily cost cap, all enforced before
enqueuing and all exempting the $0 24h cache hit; the endpoint is safe to expose
(see ADR-22). Earlier — P5.2: **items 6 and 19 REPAID** — `execute._write_cache`
is now a concurrency-safe `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` upsert (Postgres-gated race
test), and `run_pipeline` branches on `kind` so the `claim_next` checker
skip-guard is removed and checker rows run through all six steps with no crawl;
see ADR-20. Earlier — session 9: **item 2 REPAID** — P5.0 landed and is
verified live on prod (5/IP/hour + 100/day rolling caps, 429 + Retry-After
before any row or spend; worst-case abuse now bounded at ≈$1.62/day at the
measured $0.0162/analysis); the item is rewritten below as the narrower
XFF-trust posture note. Three new items from P5.1: #19 (P5.2 must remove the
`claim_next` checker guard), #20 (lead email regex, not RFC validation),
#21 (checker endpoint unthrottled until P5.6 — $0 exposure, row growth only).
Earlier session 8: item 1 largely repaid — the OpenAI leg ran live on prod
(10 × `gpt-5-nano`, measured $0.0026/analysis); what remains of #1 is
KYC-cost persistence + adapter contract tests. Earlier session 7: **old item 1 REPAID by P4.2** — the
deploy + rollback scripts ran for real on the shared VPS (deploy caught and
fixed one real bug: the prod web image build omitted devDependencies). The
list was **renumbered once more**: old 2→1, 3→2, 4→3, 5→4, 6→5, 7→6, 8→7,
9→8, 10→9, 11→10, 12→11, 13→12, 14→13, 15→14, 16→15 (archived logs cite the
numbers of their day; the session-5/6 headers carry the previous maps). Old
#8 (Caddy wiring "never exercised") is REWRITTEN as #7: the wiring is now
proven live — what remains is the manual, non-idempotent publish step and
the two-way pulse-prod lifecycle coupling. Three new items: #16 (worker
boot-race log noise), #17 (rollback's pruned-image branch still unproven +
`git checkout` working-tree hazard), #18 (prod web image ships
devDependencies).)

## Untested / never exercised

1. **Both live adapters are now proven (Anthropic ✅ session 6, OpenAI ✅
   session 8) — two residuals stand.** Session 8 (2026-07-10) ran the full
   live panel ON PROD: 10 × Claude Haiku 4.5 ($0.0135) + 10 × `gpt-5-nano`
   ($0.0026) → **measured full-panel cost $0.0162/analysis** (gemini/
   perplexity stubs $0; real KYC for anthropic.com; geo_score 0.225).
   Remaining: (a) The **KYC call's cost is not persisted** —
   `responses.cost_usd` covers the panel only, so the recorded per-analysis
   cost understates by ~1 call (~$0.002 at Haiku prices with page text as
   input); fold KYC cost into the analysis row if precise invoicing ever
   matters. (b) Still no respx-style contract tests for the adapters; price
   tables remain hardcoded from (now verified) public pricing.

## Accepted MVP shortcuts (by design, revisit before/at launch)

2. **P5.0 rate limiting trusts the first `X-Forwarded-For` entry** (the bulk
   of this item was REPAID in session 9 — the live endpoint now enforces
   5/IP/hour + 100/day rolling caps with 429 + `Retry-After` before any row
   is created). Accepted residue: XFF is client-controllable when a request
   reaches the api without the shared Caddy in front, so the *per-IP* limit
   is spoofable — the *global* daily cap (≈$1.62/day worst case at measured
   cost) is the deliberate backstop, and either limit set to `0` is a clean
   kill-switch (429 everything). Also: the daily-cap `COUNT` has no dedicated
   `created_at` index (fine at MVP volume). Escape hatch unchanged:
   `DRY_RUN=1` + redeploy.
3. **DRY_RUN always analyzes the fixed mock company "Yanki Demo Co"**,
   regardless of the submitted URL (documented in architecture.md). Deliberate:
   keeps the mock deterministic end-to-end.
4. **Mock/KYC prompt coupling:** `providers/mock.py` returns the canned KYC
   profile when the prompt contains the substring `"json object"` — which
   `kyc.build_prompt` includes. Change one, keep the other in sync (both files
   carry comments).
5. **No intra-execute heartbeat.** `claimed_at` is heartbeated between steps,
   not inside the execute loop; an execute step longer than
   `STALE_CLAIM_SECONDS` (300s) could be reclaimed mid-run. Idempotent
   delete-before-rerun makes this safe but wasteful. Fix only if real runs
   approach 300s.
6. ~~**`llm_cache` read-then-insert race** under concurrent workers could raise
   on the unique key.~~ **REPAID (P5.2):** `execute._write_cache` is now an
   upsert — delete any stale row on the key (keeps the refresh-with-fresh-
   timestamp semantic), then `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (cache_key) DO NOTHING` via
   the Postgres/SQLite dialect `insert`, then re-read. A second worker racing
   the same key is a no-op, not an `IntegrityError`; proven by the Postgres-gated
   `tests/pipeline/test_execute_race.py`. Residual (minor): the delete-first step
   means a losing concurrent writer can drop a rival's just-committed fresh row
   and replace it with its own — harmless (both answers valid, timestamp stays
   fresh, response cost is recorded from the generated result, not the cache row).
7. **The Caddy publish step is manual, non-idempotent, and coupled two-way to
   pulse-prod** (rewritten session 7 — the wiring itself is now PROVEN live by
   P4.2: aliases `yanki-web`/`yanki-api` on `pulse-prod_default`, loopback
   binds 8142/8143 for health checks, TLS issued, co-tenants undisturbed).
   What remains accepted debt: (a) `make deploy` does NOT publish — the yanki
   site block lives inside the operator's
   `~/repo/ams-pulse/deploy/config/Caddyfile.prod` (appended by hand
   2026-07-10; the repo's `deploy/caddy/*.caddy` copy is documentation now,
   and the two must be kept in sync manually); (b) appending twice = duplicate
   site key = reload failure — always `caddy validate` in-container before
   `caddy reload`, NEVER restart the shared Caddy; (c) the lifecycle coupling
   is TWO-WAY — pulse-prod must be up before `make deploy`, and while
   yanki-prod is attached a `pulse-prod down`/network recreate is blocked by
   (or strands) yanki's endpoints.
8. **The e2e CI job depends on real runner egress to example.com.** DRY_RUN
   mocks only the LLM providers; pipeline step 1 (discovery) genuinely fetches
   the submitted URL, so the spec's `https://example.com` submission needs
   outbound network from the worker container. Accepted: hosted runners allow
   egress and example.com is highly stable; a red e2e *after green health
   waits* is a likely network flake, not an app regression (the job carries a
   comment saying so). Removing the dependency would mean mocking discovery
   under DRY_RUN or whitelisting a stack-served URL past the SSRF guard —
   both app changes made purely for CI; declined for the MVP.

## Hygiene / small

9. **Node 20 on the dev host vs README's recommended 22 LTS** — everything
    green on 20; upgrade opportunistically.
10. **StepProgress / ResultsTable still have no behavior unit tests.** Partially
    repaid: both now carry axe a11y tests
    (`tests/StepProgress.a11y.test.tsx`, `tests/ResultsTable.a11y.test.tsx`), but
    nothing exercises their rendering logic. Add when they grow logic.
11. **gitleaks is pinned in two places that must move in lockstep.** `ci.yml`'s
    `secrets` job (`GITLEAKS_VERSION` + `GITLEAKS_SHA256`) and
    `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (`rev: v8.28.0`). Bump both together — and
    recompute the SHA256 from the release `checksums.txt` — or the CI layer and
    the local hook run different scanner versions.
12. **The pre-commit gitleaks hook is `language: golang`.** pre-commit
    auto-provisions its own Go toolchain to build it, so the first
    `pre-commit run` (or first commit) is heavy and needs network; an offline or
    otherwise constrained first run will stall. No system Go is required, and
    later runs are fast.
13. **Contrast fixes are guarded only by manually computed ratios.** axe's
    `color-contrast` rule is disabled under jsdom (it has no layout or paint —
    see `tests/a11y.ts`), so the P4.5 WCAG ratios are verified by hand, not by a
    running test. A token/color change that regresses contrast would pass CI.
    Re-check the ratios manually when touching the `*-soft` fills or the text
    tokens layered on them.
14. **`npm ci || npm install` fallback can mask lockfile drift.** Used in the
    frontend/contract/e2e CI jobs and both Dockerfiles (originally for the
    no-lockfile bootstrap). With `package-lock.json` now committed, a failing
    `npm ci` silently falls back to `npm install`, which may resolve different
    versions — a green job then doesn't prove the locked tree. Extra edge since
    session 5: a fallback `npm install` could pull a newer in-range
    eslint-config-next whose new warnings would trip the `--max-warnings 0`
    gate in a way the committed lockfile can't reproduce. Drop the fallback
    when convenient (low risk, low priority).
15. **ESLint 8.57 (EOL) + legacy `.eslintrc.json` deliberately kept; flat
    config + ESLint 9 deferred to the Next 16 bump.** Session 5 repaid old
    debt #10 with the minimal-risk diff: only the `lint` script changed
    (`next lint` → `eslint . --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx --max-warnings 0`), so
    the Next-16-blocking `next lint` call is gone with zero dependency/lockfile
    churn. The deferred half: `--ext` and `.eslintrc.json` BOTH stop working
    under ESLint 9's flat config, so the Next 16 / eslint-config-next 16 bump
    must swap in an `eslint.config.mjs` (FlatCompat pattern, port
    `ignorePatterns` → `ignores`) and drop `--ext` in the same change — plan it
    manually, the official `next-lint-to-eslint-cli` codemod's legacy-config
    conversion is buggy (vercel/next.js#85679). Two accepted quirks meanwhile:
    `--max-warnings 0` is deliberately stricter than `next lint` (warnings now
    fail CI — treat a future warning-level failure as a real gate, not a
    flake), and `postcss.config.mjs` stays unlinted (`.mjs` not in `--ext`;
    `next lint` never covered it either). Note: Next 16 also stops linting
    during `next build`, making this script the ONLY lint gate.
16. **The worker logs one scary-looking `UndefinedTable` error at first prod
    boot.** compose starts the worker on api `service_started`, but the api
    runs `alembic upgrade head` before uvicorn — so the worker's first poll
    can beat the migration and log a full traceback
    (`relation "analyses" does not exist`), then recover on the next poll
    (observed on the first deploy, 2026-07-10; RestartCount stayed 0). Purely
    cosmetic noise today; fix = a db-schema wait or migration-completion gate
    if it ever confuses an on-call human.
17. **`rollback.sh`'s pruned-image branch is still unproven and mutates the
    working tree.** P4.2 exercised only the images-present path (same-SHA
    rollback, clean + healthy). If the last-good image was ever pruned,
    rollback does `git checkout <sha>` + rebuild — detached HEAD, fails on a
    dirty tree, and leaves the operator's checkout moved. Surfaced by the
    session-7 pre-flight review; accepted for now (rollbacks are supervised).
18. **The prod web image ships devDependencies.** Session 7's fix for the
    build failure (`npm ci --include=dev`, needed because NODE_ENV=production
    otherwise omits the typescript devDep that `next build` requires) means
    the runtime image also carries dev packages. Correct fix later: a
    multi-stage Dockerfile (build with dev deps, run with `npm ci --omit=dev`
    or Next standalone output). Cost today: image size only.
19. ~~**`claim_next` skips `kind='checker'` rows — a deliberate P5.1 stopgap
    that P5.2 MUST remove.**~~ **REPAID (P5.2):** `run_pipeline` now branches on
    `kind` (a checker row seeds KYC from its brand+category instead of crawling
    its synthetic `checker://` url), so the guard is gone and the worker claims
    checker rows in ordinary FIFO order. `test_claim_next_skips_checker_rows` is
    replaced by `test_claim_next_claims_checker_rows` in
    `backend/tests/test_queue.py`. (Sequence P5.6 — checker rate limit, #21 —
    promptly, since checker rows now actually run and spend on real providers.)
20. **Lead email validation is a minimal regex, not RFC/deliverability
    validation** (`email-validator` isn't installed; the card allowed this).
    Some technically-invalid addresses will be accepted into
    `checker_submissions.email`. Fine for a lead gate; `pydantic[email]` is a
    drop-in swap if lead quality ever matters (relates to operator decision
    on email-gate strength, operator-expected item 13).
19a. **SPA bundle mining prioritizes non-ASCII (localized) literals** to keep
    framework noise out of the 20k text cap — so an **English-only**
    client-rendered SPA whose bundle front-loads runtime strings could still
    have real content truncated away (the live Turkish target works because
    its copy carries Turkish letters). If an English-only SPA misfires the
    same way, add a content-keyword ranking pass. Also: bundle fetches trust
    the `content-length` header + post-hoc truncation, not true streaming —
    a >2MB body without the header downloads fully before truncation.
19b. **Discovery worst-case latency grew**: homepage + 5 links + 3 bundles ×
    15s timeout ≈ 135s theoretical worst case, under but not comfortably
    under `STALE_CLAIM_SECONDS=300` (interacts with debt #5's no-heartbeat-
    inside-a-step). Observed real case: ~0.25s. Revisit if slow sites appear.
21. ~~**`POST /api/v1/checker` has no rate limit until P5.6** (deliberate lane
    ownership — P5.6 adds ip_hash population, limits, kill-switch, cost cap).
    Exposure today is $0 (worker skips checker rows, see #19) and cache hits
    are free, but an abuser can grow the `analyses`/`checker_submissions`
    tables unboundedly.~~ **REPAID (P5.6, see ADR-22):** the checker endpoint now
    derives a salted `ip_hash` (reusing the existing `ip_hash_salt` — no second
    salt) and, for a FRESH run only, enforces in order a `CHECKER_ENABLED` master
    kill-switch (default OFF → friendly parked 503, records nothing), a per-IP
    submissions/hour 429, a per-brand fresh-runs/day 429, and a rolling-24h daily
    USD cost cap (at-capacity 503). A $0 24h cache hit is exempt from all four so
    it still returns its id for the email gate. Fresh-run LLM spend is bounded to
    roughly the daily cap, not eliminated — see the residuals below.
    (The P5.6 card said "tech-debt #3 marked repaid" — a **stale renumbering
    artifact**; the real item is **#21**, repaid here.) Residuals, reported
    honestly: **(a)** the cost cap is **completion-lagged** — it sums
    `responses.cost_usd`, which the worker writes only *after* a run finishes, so
    a just-enqueued run counts as $0 at submit time. Left naked this is a real
    bypass: a distinct-triple, XFF-spoofed burst evades the per-brand and per-IP
    caps and could enqueue an unbounded backlog the worker later spends far past
    the cap. So with real keys the cap also **projects** in-flight fresh runs
    (queued/running `kind='checker'` rows) at a conservative per-run estimate
    (`_EST_CHECKER_RUN_COST_USD`), bounding the concurrent backlog to about
    `cap / est`. Residual overshoot is therefore **bounded to a small multiple of
    the cap** (if true per-run cost drifts above the estimate), not unbounded;
    retune the estimate with the price tables and at P5.7 when Gemini/Perplexity
    stop being $0 stubs. **(b)** the per-IP hash is derived from the first
    `X-Forwarded-For` entry, which is **client-controlled** even behind the
    shared Caddy (same caveat as item #2), so the per-IP cap is spoofable; the
    per-brand cap and the projected daily cost cap are the real backstops against
    a spoofed-IP burst. **(c)** a cache hit is exempt from the per-IP limit too,
    so an abuser hammering an *already-cached* brand can still grow
    `checker_submissions` rows at $0 (no spend, one shared analysis) — a far
    cheaper surface than fresh runs; making the per-IP cap count cache hits would
    429 a hammered-then-cached brand's own legitimate cache hits and break their
    email gate, so cache hits stay exempt.
