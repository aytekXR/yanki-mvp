# Yanki — Product Roadmap

*Audience: leadership + engineers. This is the **product** roadmap — the phased
path from the MVP we are building now to the transparent, affordable Semrush
alternative described in [00-first-mvp-draft.md](00-first-mvp-draft.md).*

**Scope authority is [02-mvp.md](02-mvp.md), not this file.** If it isn't in
02-mvp.md, it isn't in the MVP — it's a phase below. **Scope is frozen until day
60.** New ideas go to the backlog, not the sprint.

**This is the *what/why/when*, not the *how*.** The engineering task breakdown —
tickets, sequencing, owners — lives in
[implementation-plan.md](implementation-plan.md). Where a phase item needs build
detail, follow the link; this file does not duplicate it.

The three wedges every phase serves (from the draft): **show our work**
(published methodology, every raw answer one click away), **pricing agencies can
scale on**, and **Turkish as a first-class language**.

## Phase map at a glance

| Phase | Horizon | Theme | Buyer it unlocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Now** | This session | Prove the core loop: URL → GEO score, anonymous | Nobody yet — internal proof |
| **Next** | Weeks 2–8 | Public checker + real product: accounts, billing, weekly tracking, Turkish, competitors | Founder → In-house SEO → Agency |
| **Later** | Day 60–90+ | Scale the wedges: agency plan, AI Overviews, Arabic, export/API, compliance | Agency at volume + enterprise inbound |

---

## Now — the MVP (this session)

**Goal:** the entire loop in [02-mvp.md](02-mvp.md) works end-to-end on a live
stack — *URL in → GEO score out in ~10 minutes, with every raw answer behind
it* — and runs at $0 under `DRY_RUN=1`. This is the sole definition of done for
the session; nothing here is negotiable and nothing below it ships first.

| Item | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Anonymous URL submission (no auth) | Lowest-friction proof the loop delivers a defensible number; auth is pure overhead until we have paying users. |
| Discovery → KYC → prompts → execute → footprint → scoring pipeline | The six steps ARE the product; everything later is packaging, cadence, and depth on top of this spine. |
| Claude + OpenAI real; Gemini + Perplexity stubbed | Two real engines prove multi-engine execution and cost; stubs keep the panel shape without paying for four vendors before validation. |
| Binary footprint + primitive score `footprints / total_responses` | Intentionally primitive so it is a pure, unit-tested, *defensible* function — the "show our work" wedge starts here (ADR-11). |
| Deterministic template prompts (no LLM prompt-gen) | Testable and free; LLM/native prompt generation is a Next-phase quality lever, not a loop blocker. |
| `llm_cache` within a single job's runs | Proves the caching mechanism cheaply; the cross-account version (the real cost lever) is Next. |
| `DRY_RUN=1` mock provider + cost caps (`PROMPT_COUNT`, `MAX_RESPONSES_PER_JOB`) | CI and first-run cost $0; makes Week-1 invoice validation possible before anything goes public. |

**Sequencing:** the pipeline is strictly sequential (discovery must precede KYC,
etc.); build and test each step behind `DRY_RUN` before wiring a real key. This
is the whole session — do not start Next-phase work until the happy path renders
a score.

## Next — free checker + the real product (roughly weeks 2–8)

The draft's build plan: **checker ships weeks before the app** (it is the demand
test, lead magnet, and launch asset in one), then the full self-serve product.
Ordered by the draft's Launch 1 → Launch 3 sequence.

### 2a. Free public checker — the launch wedge (weeks 3–4, ships first)

*Engineering decomposition done (session 3): **Phase 5, P5.1–P5.11** in
[implementation-plan.md](implementation-plan.md) — build stays frozen behind the
MVP sign-off gate (P4.1 + P4.2 + first green CI).*

| Item | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Public no-signup page: brand + category → 12 fixed prompts × 4 engines, live | Every run is a demand signal and a lead; Semrush has a checker, ours must be more generous and exist in Turkish (theirs doesn't). |
| Score + engine-by-engine presence map + competitors that showed up + ≥1 full raw answer | "Show our work" from the first touch — not a teaser; the full report costs an email address (lead capture). |
| Results cached 24h per brand, rate limited, email-gated | Abuse control: caching, rate limits, email gate, fixed prompt set, daily cost check (the draft's checker-abuse mitigation). |
| **English + Turkish** at checker launch | Turkish is a launch differentiator, not a later add — the checker is where we first prove it publicly. |

### 2b. Engine + scoring depth — make the number trustworthy

| Item | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Real Gemini (with search grounding) + Perplexity engines | Four real engines with grounding are the actual panel; Gemini-with-grounding also stands in for Google until AIO tracking (Later). |
| 2 samples per prompt, frequencies not single observations | LLM answers wobble; sampling + frequencies is how we avoid the "guesswork" reputation the category earned. |
| Weighted AI Visibility Score 0–100: mention × position (1.0 / 0.7 / 0.4) × sentiment (1.0 / 0.9 / 0.5), averaged, ×100 | The defensible, published score the product sells on; the MVP's binary score is the honest placeholder until this lands. |
| Sentiment + position extraction pass (cheap model) | Inputs to the weighted score; a cheap analysis model is one of the three cost protections. |

### 2c. Turkish as a first-class language — the wedge that can't be a sprint bolt-on

| Item | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Native Turkish prompt generation (written how Turkish users ask, not translated) | If the Turkish numbers are wrong the whole differentiation story dies on day one — this is explicitly not the corner we cut. |
| Turkish suffix-aware brand/footprint matching | Turkish agglutination breaks naive string matching; footprint accuracy in TR depends on it. |
| Extraction model validated on a labelled Turkish test set before launch | A precision bar before public launch + weekly human spot-checks in beta keeps the numbers honest. |

### 2d. The app: accounts → billing → cadence

| Item | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Auth, accounts, projects + onboarding wizard (brand, site, category, up to 5 competitors, language) | Turns the anonymous loop into a product people return to; first run kicks off immediately with live progress. |
| Prompt engine: 30–60 prompts from the site + category, user edits/approves, versioned panels with annotations | "Keyword research" for GEO; site-derived panels give even small brands real signal (fixes the "small brands get junk" gap). |
| Stripe billing, Free / $49 / $129 from day one of public launch, hard caps + in-context upgrade | Category has a proven price anchor; hard limits + upgrade-at-cap protect margin. Reprice to $59/$149 *before* launch if Week-1 invoices run high — never after. |
| Weekly scheduling (top prompts weekly, full panel monthly) + weekly digest email + alerts | The recurring loop is the retention engine; alerts fire on score move ≥10pts, competitor enters a priority answer, or you disappear from one — max one alert mail/day. |
| **Cross-account `llm_cache`** (identical prompt+engine cached 24h across accounts) | The big cost lever — the MVP's within-job cache generalized; central to hitting "API cost < 35% of plan price". |
| Answers Explorer: every metric links to the raw answers behind it | The trust feature — no dead ends; this is the "show our work" wedge as UI. |
| Competitor share-of-voice, mention rate per engine, average position, citations (own pages vs third-party) | Share-of-voice is the agency-facing story; the third-party citation list is quietly the best screen in the product. |

**Sequencing:** checker (2a) ships first as the demand test and recruits 5 design
partner agencies on free Pro; engine/scoring depth (2b) and Turkish (2c) run in
parallel because the checker needs both to be credible; the app (2d) follows with
partners in beta, billing in test, then public launch. Detailed tickets:
[implementation-plan.md](implementation-plan.md).

## Later — scale the wedges (day 60–90 and beyond)

Deliberately deferred until the checker/app data tells us which wedge to double
down on. Each is gated on a day-90 decision below.

| Item | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Agency plan ~$299/mo** — 10 projects (kept fully separate) + white-label PDF reports | The agency owner is the multiplier and the highest-leverage buyer; the 5 design partners will "pull the agency plan out of us" when it's time. Day 60–90 decision. |
| **Google AI Overviews tracking** | Our biggest admitted gap vs Semrush; needs SERP scraping or a paid SERP API. We say it out loud on the comparison page and close it around day 60–90 — hiding it would cost us the transparency story. |
| **Arabic** language support | Ship only if Turkey delivers 20%+ of signups organically — proof the native-language playbook repeats before we spend on a third language. |
| **CSV export + public API** | Export is a Pro-tier ask already; API is "later, when someone asks and pays" — not needed to prove willingness to pay. |
| **Compliance-grade tier $500+/mo** (accuracy guarantees, audit trails) | Only if regulated/enterprise brands come inbound asking; the pipeline already supports the audit trail, so it's packaging, not a rebuild. |

**Explicitly still NOT building** (from the draft, until someone asks and pays):
content generation, an AI recommendation engine (generic advice is the most
mocked feature in the category — we ship specific findings instead), attribution/
analytics integrations, SSO, mobile, more engines.

---

## Day-90 decision gates

Read the numbers at day 90 and let them pick the next investment (from
[00-first-mvp-draft.md](00-first-mvp-draft.md)):

- **Agencies dominate paying accounts:** build the agency plan next (workspaces,
  white-label PDF).
- **Turkey delivers 20%+ of signups organically:** ship Arabic, double the local
  content.
- **Regulated / enterprise brands come inbound asking about accuracy and audit
  trails:** add a compliance-grade tier at $500+/mo — the pipeline already
  supports it.
- **Free-to-paid under 2%:** stop building, fix packaging and pricing first.

---

## First-90-days success metrics

The targets we recalibrate against after two weeks of real data (from
[00-first-mvp-draft.md](00-first-mvp-draft.md); ranges are ranges, not promises):

- **3000 checker runs, 600 signups, 40 paying, $2.5–4k MRR.**
- **Activation:** 60% of signups see their first snapshot, median under 10
  minutes.
- **Month-2 logo churn under 8%** — the number leadership will actually stare at;
  monitoring tools die of curiosity churn.
- **Run reliability 95%+, API cost per paying customer under 35% of plan price.**

## How the MVP's out-of-scope list maps to phases

Every item [02-mvp.md §4](02-mvp.md) marks out-of-scope has a home here — this
table is the contract between "not now" and "when":

| 02-mvp.md out-of-scope item | Phase | Where above |
|---|---|---|
| Auth, accounts, projects | **Next** | 2d — app: accounts |
| Billing / Stripe / plan limits | **Next** | 2d — Stripe Free/$49/$129 |
| Scheduling, recurring scans, weekly digests + alerts | **Next** | 2d — weekly scheduling + digest + alerts |
| Sentiment analysis and position weighting (score stays binary) | **Next** | 2b — weighted 0–100 score |
| Turkish language (native prompts + Turkish suffix matching) | **Next** | 2c — Turkish first-class |
| Cross-account cache (MVP caches within a job only) | **Next** | 2d — cross-account `llm_cache` |
| Real Gemini + Perplexity engines (stubbed in MVP) | **Next** | 2b — real Gemini + Perplexity |
| 2-samples-per-prompt sampling | **Next** | 2b — 2 samples per prompt |
| Competitor comparison, share of voice, citations, Answers Explorer UI | **Next** | 2d — SoV, citations, Answers Explorer |
| CSV export, historical trends | **Next / Later** | Trends land with weekly tracking (2d); CSV export is a Pro feature but full export/API is **Later**. |
| Google AI Overviews tracking | **Later** | AI Overviews tracking |
| Arabic | **Later** | Arabic (gated on Turkey traction) |
| White label, API, SSO, mobile, more engines | **Later** | Agency white-label + export/API; SSO/mobile/more engines stay deferred |
| Compliance / audit-trail tier | **Later** | Compliance-grade $500+/mo tier |
